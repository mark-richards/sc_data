#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Pearce chips into the pocket and Sheridan manages to take the mark after pushing into full flight. Tom lines up just prior to the final siren and misses to the far side from 25. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: McStay forces the turnover after Taylor ducked in the marking contest. Lewis receives from his teammates hard work&#044; and makes no mistake from 35! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:41)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hanley is first to the drop zone as the Lions bomb long once more. Pearce throws it on the boot under severe pressure&#044; and does miss the opportunity from 25. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:41)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Ballantyne trots down the wing and picks out an unmarked Walters&#044; 40 out directly in front. Michael has had a somewhat quiet day&#044; but adds some gloss with that major! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:10)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Bastinac takes it out of the congestion and has a quick snap attempt from 35&#044; but misses to the far side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:24)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: That may have been the easiest of the lot. Neale receives out of the middle and flicks off to Tucker. Darcy waltzes through unopposed and finishes from 30! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Suban sends it inside 50 and Taberner manages to bring it to ground once more. Mayne receives and flicks it off to Ballantyne&#044; who snaps truly for his fourth from the pocket! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:25)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Jansen finds it at ground level deep in the pocket. Pushed on the kick by the challenging Collins&#044; Jarrad misses to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:25)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cutler takes the intercept mark as a rare forward pressure act results in a turnover. Tom lines up the set shot and from well outside 50&#044; the half back flanker sends it through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hanley is caught unawares as he attempts to speed out of defensive 50 with ball in hand&#044; but is caught by Weller. Lachie receives the free and nabs his fourth from 35! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:37)</span><br />
