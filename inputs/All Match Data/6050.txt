#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Ablett&#044; Ah Chee and finally Matera marks inside 35. With little time to waste&#044; Brandon still takes 20 seconds off the clock. His kick is lackadaisical and misses to the far side.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Bowes grabs the second of his career with a devastating run through the middle of Etihad. Gathering the ball at pace&#044; Jack unleashes from 60 and manages to bounce it through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:46)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hrovat takes the strong mark and wastes little time by dabbing the pass onto the chest of McDonald. Luke marks and shoots from 40 on the slight but misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Wood unloads from 55 as the Suns have difficulty with stringing possessions together through the middle of the ground. Mason bounces his effort for a minor. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:29)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Ablett grabs the goal within fifteen seconds of the restart. Hall sends it long and Lonergan finds it at ground level. Off to Gary and the champ dribbles it home from 35! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: If the result wasn't decided already&#044; it is now! Ziebell&#044; Hansen and Brown link by hand and Ben receives from point blank range. He sends his sixth to the top tier! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:19)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Saad sends it long to Ablett and the two time Brownlow medallist drops the mark. He flicks back to Fiorini who finds Ah Chee on the lead. Callum goals from 25! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Anderson receives the free after Ablett tackled him without ball in hand. The former Hawk lines up for the potential sealer and he does deliver from 25! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Roos send it long to Brown once more and Ben again repays the faith&#044; clunking a strong contested grab inside 30. On the slight angle he kicks his fifth&#044; a personal best! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Matera gives away the very questionable free kick for a throw&#044; which replays suggest was anything but. Brown receives the free and takes full advantage from 40 on the flank! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:05)</span><br />
