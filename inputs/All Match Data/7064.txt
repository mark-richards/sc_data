#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Amon bullets a kick to Houston who clunks it on his chest just inside the 50m arc. He goes back and launches it through the big sticks&#044; putting the icing on the cake.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Brown is awarded a shot on goal as the benefactor of a Westhoff hold. His simple shot from 30&#044; however&#044; is wasteful.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:34)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: McKenna sends the footy back from where it came.  Stringer protects the ball drop to mark but from 50m&#044; Jake misses to the left. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:22)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Powell-Pepper feeds it out of congestion to Rockliff who lowers his eyes to poke a pass to the leading Marshall. From 40m&#044; he slots his third of the day.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:21)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: McDonald-Tipungwuti catches Amon HTB before popping a pass inbound to Stringer. Jake goes back and boots it sweetly though from outside the 50 arc. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Clurey outmarks Snelling on the wing then links up with Marshall who finds Powell-Pepper in the pocket. He wheels around on his right and snaps it through. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:28)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: An under-pressure wayward Tippa kick lands with Powell-Pepper&#044; well within range. Sam's 40m shot scrapes the woodwork. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Dylan Clarke has a moment to forget&#044; booting the centre clearance completely in the wrong direction. Rozee pounces and snaps from the pocket but can't convert.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Ladhams centres from the flank and Ryder stands tall to mark above Hartley at the 35. From directly in front&#044; he sneaks it home.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Great bodywork from Robbie Gray to work Saad the wrong side of the drop allows him to run out the back into an open goal&#044; despite Saad hot on his heels. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:18)</span><br />
