#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Christensen evades a couple&#044; and then handballs centrally to the livewire in Lewis Taylor. Taylor goes for home&#044; but his shot from 40 on the slight misses to the right. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:51)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: McStay hits up McGuane on the lead with the shot chip pass&#044; and the former Tiger marks 40 metres from goal on the flank. Luke goes back and slots the major! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:36)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Brilliant pressure in the Lions forward line enables Hanley to get a shot away just 15 out from goal on the slight angle&#044; but incredibly he just misses to the far side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:51)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Clarke gives away the free kick for holding the ball after Dixon applied a pressure act&#044; although it appeared to be a somewhat dubious decision. Charlie slots it from 25! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Lynch takes another brilliant grab&#044; this time opposed to Clarke in the one v one contest! From the set shot&#044; 35 metres out&#044; Tom slots his fifth! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Mayes booms it in long and McGuane takes a strong contested grab in the four man strong pack. From 30 on the slight&#044; Luke goals! Just two kick in it! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:35)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Lewis Taylor goes this way and that&#044; evading Malceski and then Saad with exquisite footwork deep in the pocket. He finishes off the classy play with a predictable finish! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:51)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Harbrow chips it in to the leading Dixon who leads Andrews with ease and takes the regulation mark. Charlie lines up from 45 on the flank and sends it through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Adcock flicks it wide to McStay and Daniel kicks the goal of the day with a classic effort pressed up on the boundary&#044; with Matera trailing! Perfect drop punt effort! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Miller goes long to the Lynch/Merrett contest and due to Daniel trailing in late&#044; he could do no more than give the free away. 35 out on the flank&#044; Tom misses to the far side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:49)</span><br />
