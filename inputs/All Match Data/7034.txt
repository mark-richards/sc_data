#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Ziebell's long distance shot falls short and Larkey is on the scene to take a towering grab at point blank range. Nick goes back and kicks his fifth! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Newnes paces down the wing and dabs the pass to Bruce. Josh moves Tarrant away from the drop zone and clunks the grab. He finishes another for his sixth straight! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:28)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Wood chips the pass and finds Larkey on the lead&#044; as the Roos look to finish strongly. Nick lines up from 35 on the slight angle and has no trouble splitting the middle! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Make that five straight for the dead eye Bruce. The Saints get out the back through Parker&#044; who flicks to Josh. He finishes from close range! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Saints pace down the other end and Ross finds Membrey with the short inside 50 dab pass. The former Swan makes no mistake&#044; converting from 40 on the slight! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Coffield turns it over in the heart of the defence&#044; his errant picked off by Zurhaar. Cam settles but is unable to send through his sixth&#044; missing from 45. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Thompson intercepts the pill through the middle and sends it to Brown. Brown gathers off the deck&#044; turns with ease and snaps home from 20! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Make that a fifth for the mercurial Zurhaar. Cam takes the lead up mark boundary side&#044; 35 metres from goal. He finishes truly with the banana! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cunnington darts the pass to the lead of Brown&#044; Ben taking the mark unopposed. Lining up for his 37th of the season&#044; the North star pulls it from 45. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Coffield gives the free away after a desperate attempt to spoil Brown. Ben makes no mistake from 25&#044; sending the Roos back out to a five goal lead! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 15:35)</span><br />
