#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: It's icing on the cake now as Ben Long joins the party with his first of the day. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The Saints kick away as Bruce helicopters it from 60 and the Sherrin bounces exactly as he would have liked.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Newnes finds Billings in the pocket who unselfishly chips it to Membrey. After a sidestep&#044; Tim kicks the easiest of goals. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:10)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Walker kicks dangerously into the middle where Jack Steele intercepts. Membrey marks the delivery in the pocket and checksides brilliantly. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:57)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The quickest of replies from Brisbane! Another stoppage goal&#044; this time from Mitch Robinson who launches it from downtown. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Membrey kicks up the wing to Billings&#044; who turns around to multiple teammates free goalside. Long's there&#044; take your pick&#044; Gresham finishes it.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:39)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Andrews does well to draw the opposition player and then mongrels a kick into the 50. A diving Jarrod Berry takes the mark and kicks through the big sticks. Lions still alive. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:28)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Savage intercepts from Beams and hits up Billings on the lead. From just on 50&#044; Jack misses. 5 shots today for 2.3 <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: With his speed&#044; Jack Steven runs on to a Ben Long kick&#044; steps around Hodge&#044; and kick wonderfully from 50m to put the Saints back in front.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 29:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: McCartin marks close to goal with a runner steaming forward&#044; but elects to hold on to it&#044; before quickly passing to Bruce. It could have been a muck-up&#044; but Bruce kicks the goal.   <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 26:21)</span><br />
