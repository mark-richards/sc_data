#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Daniel gives to Suckling 50m out on a slight angle&#044; he has a moment to wind up but snaps wide. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:28)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: The hapless Young is pinged for a hold on Patton 35m out wide on the flank. Patton boots goal number four. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:49)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Biggs passes to Dickson 50m out on a slight angle&#044; the set shot falls on the line but Corr touched it over the line&#044; second goal for him. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: This is junk time now&#044; not much happening. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: McLean bombs long to the square&#044; Redpath is front and centre for the Wallis contest but fumbles the ball over the behind line. Oh dear. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Murphy gives to Stringer in a phonebox in the pocket&#044; he snaps OOTF. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Dunkley gives to Cloke in a pack who baulks and snaps off a step from 50m on a slight angle... OOTF. That sums it up: Dogs shooting from very poor spots. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Greene plays his HFF link role to perfection&#044; marking and wheeling for the quick kick across CHF to the other side for Whitfield to mark untouched 40m out and goal. Too good. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:04)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Greene marks a long Whitfield ball from the wing in front of Williams 40m out on the flank. His set shot falls on the behind line and is rushed. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:19)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Patton passes intelligently around the corner from the wing to Hopper 45m out on the flank. Hopper kicks the first goal of Q4. It's junk time now. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:14)</span><br />
