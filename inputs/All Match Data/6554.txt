#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Ball goes to the wing after the centre clearance&#044; Blakely gives away 50m to Cripps to ice the game for the Eagles. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 32:34)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Tucker goals on the turn from 15m on the flank after a feed by Banfield from the pocket&#044; 1:03 to go and two kicks in it&#044; still practically impossible. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 31:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Waterman gives to LeCras who misses from 30m on the flank&#044; time has gone now for Fremantle. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:19)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Eagles start some tempo behind the wing&#044; too late for the charge now. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Blakely finds Fyfe to mark in front of Yeo 45m out on the flank. Fyfe shows a distinct lack of self-confidence on the set shot&#044; and it drops to be rushed. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:34)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Shuey runs down the wing&#044; reaches the HFF and goes long to the square&#044; Rioli is spoiled but keeps his feet to butter up and snap but Hamling gets a finger to it&#044; behind! 3:52. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Fyfe roves a McCarthy contest at the hotspot and gives to Ballantyne who kicks a trademark goal from the pocket 25m out. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:04)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: McCarthy catches Barrass HTB on the wing and goes long to the hotspot&#044; Fyfe can't mark but gets a high contact free on Redden... then misses. Dockers aren't winning this one. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Gaff passes to Kennedy near the boundary 40m out on a classic kick-mark Eagles attack around the outer wing. JJK threads the needle&#044; that's probably the sealer with 7:05 to play! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Redden gives to Yeo running down the flank for a running shot from 35m&#044; the Eagles keep nailing those and that's another! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:43)</span><br />
