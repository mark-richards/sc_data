#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Josh Kelly misses his chance for the knock-out blow&#044; taking the margin to 4 points. The Cats' last-chance rebound is muffled and the Giants chalk up the win!  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Taranto marks the Mumford pass just inside the forward 50. His kick to the hot spot is thumped through by Stanley for a behind. 3 points the margin. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Finlayson winds up and blasts it from distance&#044; but his shot is also across the face. The Giants continue to dominate possessions&#044; but can't convert on the scoreboard. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Daniels mongrels a floating kick toward goal that sways and sways before going through for a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Himmelberg takes a phenomenal Jonathan Brown-esque mark&#044; makes a few moments to catch his breath&#044; then passes to Finlayson in the pocket. He snaps truly to draw scores level. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Constable turns it over on his defensive HBF. Reid picks it up and kicks waywardly inside 50&#044; where it fortunately falls in the lap of Buntine. From 40&#044; he misses left.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Phil Davis fumbles near the 50&#044; resulting in an Ablett pickup. He dishes to Hawkins who dances and weaves before kicking to the advantage of Rohan. He marks in the pocket. Goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: It's a chain of kicks from Menegola to Miers to Atkins. The mature-age recruit misses narrowly to the right from 47&#044; giving the Cats a 1-point lead. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Cameron marks over the top of Duncan at 35. Unfortunately for GWS he can't line up his shot on target&#044; hooking it right for a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: With 5 seconds left in the third quarter&#044; Josh Kelly spins around in the pocket and snaps on his left. His attempt is off hands and results in a minor score.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(3 Qtr Time)</span><br />
