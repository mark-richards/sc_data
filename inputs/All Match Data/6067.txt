#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Game&#044; set&#044; match! The Giants triumph with some late Johnson magic proving decisive! Relentless pressure over the last few minutes was enough to see them gain the W. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Johnson hits the pack at pace and the ball happens to fall his way. The former Cat slams it on the boot from point blank range and grabs the lead with 30 seconds left! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:29)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cameron attempts the soccer and it appears to be touched. However the goal umpire calls a behind. A review is required and the decision is a minor. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Pendlebury&#044; Moore&#044; Greenwood link up before Levi sends it out of the stoppage with the looping handball. He finds Maynard and the half back hammers through his second from 45! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Another goal&#044; another lead change as this one is set for a helter skelter last seven minutes. Ward sends it long and Patton takes the grab. He goals from 45 on the boundary! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:28)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Taranto dabs the pass onto the chest of Patton as the Giants win it from the coalface once more. Jonathon shoots from 25 on the sharp angle and he misses to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: DeGoey&#044; Grundy and back again before Jordan finds Sidebottom by hand. Steele finds Reid with the bullet pass. Ben slams it through from the best part of 60 metres! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:28)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The end to end action continues as the Pies force the ball from defence to offence in one slick movement. Blair has the opportunity to settle and shoot but he misses from 40. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cameron forces the pill forward after relentless Giants pressure gains the inside 50. Taranto grabs the pill off the deck and shoots with the banana. Minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hoskin-Elliot&#044; Wells&#044; Moore and Phillips as Tom works hard to mark out the back unopposed. Tom shoots from 35 on the flank and horribly pulls the effort to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:10)</span><br />
