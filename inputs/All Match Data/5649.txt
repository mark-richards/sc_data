#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Giants move it by hand and actually manage a fumble or two without any pressure coming there way. Eventually Palmer flicks it over to Whitfield&#044; who goals from point blank! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:51)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Breust moves it wide to Gunston by hand. The former Crow receives and ends with a classy finish to cap a high class afternoon with his fifth major! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: McEvoy marks and flicks it off to the speeding Smith. Isaac whacks it on the boot from a step inside 50&#044; but he pulls it to the near side from the flank region. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Shiel produces a perfect chipped effort to allow Palmer to run and jump at the ball&#044; taking a strong grab. From 40 on the flank&#044; Rhys slots the major! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Patfull gets Puopolo high in the attempted tackle&#044; and Paul will line up from the acute angle&#044; 35 metres from goal. Last weeks match winner drifts it to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:19)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Mitchell finds Rioli with a short dab pass as the Hawks won a rare centre clearance. Cyril slots the set shot from 50&#044; directly in front! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Greene slots another! The ball drops the way of Toby as Steele sends them deep into attack. Toby slots it from deep in the pocket for his third of the day! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:57)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Birchall continues on with his horrendous afternoon&#044; turning it over from the kick-in. It lands the way of Scully&#044; and the former Demon slots the goal from the top of the square! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Ward takes an excellent pack mark as the Giants win a quick clearance from the centre stoppage. The former Dog trots in but pulls it to the right from 55. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:49)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Greene marks ahead of Howe as Coniglio picked out the Giants number 4. From 50 on the flank&#044; Toby slots the major to the crowds roar! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:06)</span><br />
