#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Siren sounds. Game over and the Pies have finally announced what they can produce in season 2016! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Smith receives the free kick for high contact as the Cats again press forward from the centre stoppage. The former Sun slots the consolation goal from 25 on the slight! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:57)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Sidebottom darts it onto the chest of the leading Grundy who takes it out ahead of Smith. From 25 on the sharp angle&#044; Brodie trots in with less than 2 minutes to play and slots it! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Cats win it from the centre clearance and Caddy is the one to take advantage. He moves through to 35 on the slight&#044; but manages to whack it into the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Duncan turns it over coming out of defence and it allows the Pies to waltz into another open goal! Pendlebury found it&#044; and moved it centrally to De Goey.Jordan finished with ease! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:22)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Selwood takes another terrific mark in the one on one v Frost. From 30 on the slight&#044; Tom sends through his fourth and keeps the Cats in it! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:39)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cox just about finalises the results to the fanatical roar that only the Pies faithful can produce! Treloar moved it out of traffic and sent it to Mason who finished from 40! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:10)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Moore is allowed a run and jump at the pill&#044; and Darcy pulls down the ripping mark ahead of Henderson and Enright. Darcy lines up from 35 on the slight and splits the middle! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Pies then speed it from coast to coast. Grundy goals out the back as Howe took it on through the corridor and enabled a series of one on one wins! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Caddy wins the free and wastes little time in heading long in the Hawkins region. Tom brings it to ground&#044; but Duncan misses the opportunity from deep in the pocket. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:20)</span><br />
