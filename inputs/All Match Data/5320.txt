#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Bombers get home in an absolute cliff hanger!

From outside 50&#044; Joe has five! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:13)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Watts chips it in short to Kennedy-Harris&#044; who in turn finds the full back in McDonald. From 45&#044; he slams it home to put the demons&#044; pardon the pun&#044; to bed! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: No matter&#044; in the very next play the ball gets bombed forward and Garlett reads it off Dawes again&#044; leads Baguley to the pill and snaps truly from deep in the pocket! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Garlett gets to the front of the Dawes/Steinberg contest and he roves it superbly&#044; but his resulting shot misses to the right hand side from 50. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Gwilt kicked in to Ambrose who was clearly about to stroll into an open goal&#044; but a horrendous bounce denies Patrick a simple possession and he's caught! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:44)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hurley turns it over through the corridor and it hurts&#044; with Vandenberg spotting up an unopposed McDonald on the resulting play. 40 out&#044; he misses once more. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hooker gives away the free kick after a push in the back off the ball meant the free was paid up the ground. Pressed up on the boundary&#044; McDonald hits the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:28)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Viney receives out of the centre clearance and runs through to the 50 metre arc. He sets sail for home&#044; but he just manages to hit the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:46)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Zach Merrett turns it over out of defence straight to Jetta who in turn will line up from the 50 metre arc directly in front.
