#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Stringer misses a speculator from wide on the HFF. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Parker passes to Franklin 40m out on the flank&#044; who plays on and misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:53)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Bontempelli sprays a relatively easy set shot from 20m on a slight angle&#044; after a lot of meaningless junk time stat accumulation by both sides. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Lloyd marks and goals from 40m on a slight angle. This is garbage time&#044; no doubt. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Hewett passes to Franklin 45m out wide on the flank. Right in Buddy's set shot wheelhouse... but he just misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Towers marks 30m out on the flank and kicks his first goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:10)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Papley passes short to Parker after the first centre bounce&#044; yet another centre clearance to Sydney. Parker lines up from 45m in the corridor&#044; and starts junk time with the sealer. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 0:57)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Heeney sharks a pressured Johannisen handball on the HFF and tries his luck from just outside 50m... takes an off break the wrong side of the goalpost. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 30:35)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Jones spoils a Boyd kick to Daniel in the centre&#044; runs to CHF and shoots&#044; but the ball drops in the square for Roberts to rush. That really would have settled in nearing 3QT. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 29:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Roughead roves a Franklin ball to Reid 20m out on the flank but gets dispossessed in a tackle by Reid&#044; Papley is front and centre for the crumb goal. Sydney has the answers. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 27:06)</span><br />
