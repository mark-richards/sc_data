#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Finlayson infringes Sicily off the ball and the down the ground free kick is paid.

He gathers the ball at half forward&#044; runs his measure and bounces it through with pressure coming from all angles! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: McEvoy gets out the back and manages to take the grab leading his opponent in Simpson. The former Saint lines up from 35 on the flank and duly convert! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Make that two in a row for the Hawks! Roughead is unable to take the leading grab but Breust hits the ball at pace with classic roving work. He settles and goals from 20! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:57)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Hawks grab the first of the fourth! They swing the ball coast to coast through the middle of Spotless Stadium. Duryea and Breust combine with Luke punting it through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Taranto grabs the loose pill on the paint of the boundary line. With eyes only for goal&#044; Tim throws boot to ball and swings through a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:14)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Giants make it three in a row with six seconds left to play in this third term. Ward gathers the pill in the stoppage&#044; loses Hardwick and goals with ease from 25! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(3 Qtr Time)</span><br />
