#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Wingard flies for the mark and pulls it in as the Power are now hammering it into the forward line relentlessly. Chad shoots and slots his third from 30! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:23)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Ryder takes the strong mark deep in the pocket as the Power win yet another stoppage. The former Bomber shoots for goal but hooks to the far side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: HAMISH HARTLETT! The Power have sealed the game with Hamish sending it through from the centre square! The relentless attitude has paid off for the team wearing teal.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:25)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Sam Gray finds Wines in a heap of space. Ollie gathers&#044; breaks the tackle and sets for home. His hooking effort from 25 misses to the far side for a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:37)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hold your horses! Very late overturn after it appears Cunningham got a finger to the ball. Behind to the Power. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Powell-Pepper hammers through his third of the afternoon! Perhaps the sealer&#044; Sam bullocks his way through the pack and on the repeat effort manages to slot it through from 25! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Jack hits the stoppage at pace and manages to gather. Speeding toward the boundary&#044; he hooks it back to the goal mouth but swings it to the far side for a minor. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Parker&#044; Reid and Towers link up through the middle after Hartlett appeared to make a fatal error with a dropped mark through the corridor. Dean misses from outside 50 on the run. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:29)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Franklin sends it to the goal mouth. A ten strong pack fight it out and it appeared that Reid got it through on the line.Score review called for and touched behind is the decision. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:39)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Franklin takes a terrific leading mark on the HFF. He sends it long and Jack produces a brilliant crumbing performance to keep the ball forward and finishes truly off the deck! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:19)</span><br />
