<em style='color:#a0a'>RGriffen</em>: can't believe Corey Ellis is doing this<br><em style='color:#a0a'>RGriffen</em>: I don't have Cogs&#044; injury prone as a SC option.

Don't seen it lasting. <br><em style='color:#a0a'>RGriffen</em>: Zerrett looks done for the day<br><em style='color:#a0a'>RGriffen</em>: this is ugly so far. Essendon zoning deep and wide to stop run and carry. All but 1 tigers shot have been hit up passes<br><em style='color:#000;margin-bottom:-2px'><b class="ticon tGE"></b> penguins00</em>: He looked a bit out of sync early.
