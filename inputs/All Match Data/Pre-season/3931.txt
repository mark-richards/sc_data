<em>BlueBoys#5</em>: should carlton fans be worried yet? <br><em>Meldrum23</em>: and i don't care what you say.. easy isn't it?<br><em>m0neyball</em>: i dont care what anyone says - getting belted 62 to 0 in a half of footy is a terrible way to end a preseason.<br><em>Meldrum23</em>: is this real life?<br><em>m0neyball</em>: Carlton havent scored a single point for almost 2 hours...<br><em>Meldrum23</em>: if carlton won all the games this nab cup people would be saying we are trying to hard..<br><em>E Kavastar</em>: Carlton won the NAB Cup a few years ago and got the wooden spoon. Maybe they're trying the opposite this year?<br><em>GoLions</em>: when was the last time carlton scored? i couldve sworn they were this score in the 2nd qtr<br><em>dannoaus</em>: Same cards all defenders and would be mids for clt.pick me<br><em>Meldrum23</em>: ill cop anything pokerface as long as its in the season proper.. please<br><em>lozdaleg</em>: @arch Oh no I doubt  we will win a game this year<br><em>Pokerface</em>: im not trying to be a comedian. i just see lots of carlton defenders here who forget who they are playing<br>
