But mainly in defence&#044; sneaking forward for a goal<br><em>jfitty</em>: Byrnes seems to be playing forward&#044; but pushing up the ground a little<br><em>R.Griff</em>: Dmac a job where it looks like he'll never get the ball. Im not watching to closely but I think Half Forward<br><em>Murf2Gibbs</em>: Where is Jacobs playing please who's watching? Wing? <br><em>dmac0712</em>: what sort of role is byrnes playing can anyone tell me?<br><em>Zarts</em>: btw monty&#044; I think your description for frawley 'has clark' is... incorrect :P <br><em>Zarts</em>: yeah loving the look of jacobs...
