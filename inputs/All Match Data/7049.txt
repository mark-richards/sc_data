#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Another free to the Lions is picked out for in-the-back on McCluggage against Pittard. Hugh nails the shot as the siren sounds. Well done&#044; Lions.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Answerth sends a kick inside 50 and a soft-as-you'll-see free kick is paid against Thompson on McInerny for a block. He makes the most of it&#044; taking the Lions to a 6-point lead.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 32:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Zorko bullies his way forward and handballs over the top to McStay&#044; but his under-pressure shot from 25 is wide. Scores are level with two minutes on the clock. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Polec marks a hasty Brisbane clearance and will go back for a shot of his own. His shot drops short but Thomas crumbs and goals&#044; putting the Roos in front! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Goldstein takes it out of the ruck and clears his defensive lines&#044; however only as far as the booming left boot of Daniel Rich. From 55&#044; he launches it goalward and it's flawless. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A soft arm-bar free kick against McInerney in the ruck allows Brown a shot at goal. From 40m&#044; Ben makes the most of his opportunity.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Polec&#044; Higgins&#044; and Anderson link up&#044; with Zurhaar the last link in the chain. From 45&#044; directly in front&#044; Cam slices the shot.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: McCluggage catches Thomas high&#044; gifting the Roo a shot on goal from smack on 50. Without significant angle&#044; Tarryn strikes it superbly and it's straight through the middle. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:22)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Witherden receives out the back of the contest&#044; swinging onto his right boot from 40 under pressure. Following a score review&#044; touched on the line is the final call. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Berry catches Polec HTB just outside the arc. He lines up and shoots from 52 but the connection isn't perfect&#044; thumped over for a minor score.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:05)</span><br />
