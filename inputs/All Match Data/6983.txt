#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Lienert roosts a kick toward goal from outside 50 which misses. Port is able to recapture the footy following the kickout&#044; but Butters' set 40m shot isn't straight either.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Motlop receives from Butters but can't keep his running shot on target&#044; missing to the right from 40m. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Duursma gets a scraping toe on the footy in the goalsquare. The umpire's call is a goal&#044; but a review indicates Morrison got a fingernail on it.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Gunston caps off a clear BOG performance with a sixth goal. This one was a 40m set shot on a 45-degree angle.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:14)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Impey takes a bounce on the wing and kicks to a paddock between Puopolo and the goals. There's no way Jonas is catching Poppy as the Hawk puts the game beyond doubt. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Motlop sparks a counter-attack which finishes with Ladhams marking the Duursma inside-50 kick. Adjacent to the boundary&#044; the first gamer's shot is flawless.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:57)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Lienert makes no effort to dispose of the ball while under the Breust tackle. Luke earns the free kick and shoots from 40m but misses to the right. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: O'Meara is able to squeeze a hurried snap out of congestion that narrowly flies wide.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Pittonet picks up the loose Sherrin in the pocket and hands to Gunston. Jack is tackled over the behind line&#044; resulting in a minor score for Hawthorn. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Ladhams cleverly slaps the footy down to Westhoff who pops a shallow kick over the top to Powell-Pepper. From 35m&#044; he sprays it OOTF. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:28)</span><br />
