#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: McAllen finds McVeigh on the short lead. Jarrad goes back quickly with time not on his side. The shot is missed to the near side from 30 on the flank. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Grundy turns it over with a daring kick through the corridor. Ibbotson spoils it forward straight to Mayne&#044; who runs it into 30 and seals the win for the Dockers! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: 130 seconds left of this game. 9 point margin. Can the Swans bridge the gap? <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:14)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Massive review to determine whether the ball hit the post and if not&#044; Tippett whacked it home from point blank. Questionably the review deems the ball to have hit the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:41)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Mayne is found with a simple pass unattended with McVeigh the first to pick him up. From a couple of steps within the paint of 50&#044; on the flank&#044; he misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Mzungu centres to the hot spot with a phenomenal delivery&#044; allowing Pavlich to lead ahead of Richards and take the mark on the dive. From 45 on the slight&#044; the skipper goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:09)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Fyfe to Suban to Pavlich&#044; who has the flying shot from 45 on the slight&#044; but some strong team pressure by the Swans is all that's needed for the miss to occur. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:13)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Franklin finds Lloyd out the back of the stoppage&#044; ahead of the desperate Johnson. From 45 out directly in front&#044; Jake hammers it home! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Parker takes the uncontested mark after an extremely hard run from defence to offence. His kick at goal misses poorly to the far side&#044; from 30. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:29)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Fyfe works hard around the stoppage and eventually receives from Clarke&#044; but his snap shot misses to the left hand side from 35. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:29)</span><br />
