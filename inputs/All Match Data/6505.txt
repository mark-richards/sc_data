#####<em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Joyce spills the intercept mark in his defensive 50 and it falls to Waite. He skids a shot toward goal from 40 but it hits the woodwork. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Martin receives a free kick for high contact against Mcdonald. He pops a neat kick over the top into the path of Lyons. From 30 out in the pocket he bends it through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Martin roves the tap from a throw in inside 50. He bustles through traffic and dishes it out to Bowes. Bowes snaps from 30 and it sails through!  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Cunnington shows some class to keep the ball in play under pressure on the wing. His kick just trails Hartung who is streaming into his attacking 50. He shoots from 40 and misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Kolodjashnij intercepts a quick kick out of the Roos' defensive 50 and finds Miller all on his own 40 out directly in front. He hooks the set shot for a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Mcdonald coughs it up deep in his defensive pocket to MacPherson. He snaps from a tough angle but misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 1:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Sexton gets a quick snap out of heavy traffic in the pocket. It gets more height than distance and just goes over the top of the goal post for a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 29:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: May shanks a kick deep in defence and puts it out on the full. Dumont takes the kick from 30 out on the boundary and bends it through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 23:41)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Cunnington clears from a stoppage on the wing. Ziebell holds his position against May and marks 30 out on the flank. His set shot is a goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 22:09)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Dumont handballs out of the stoppage to Hartung. With some space he takes his time to size up the snap but it's touched and goes through for a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 13:26)</span><br />
