#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Kelly finds Fantasia on the lead and Orazio marks as the full time siren sounds! The quality medium sized forward sends through his fifth of the night as the Bombers start 2 & 0! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:14)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Zaharakis sends it through to send the Bombers faithful into delirium! David receives after Watson's second attempt to send it forward and the onballer makes no mistake! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Rockliff turnover proves catastrophic. Kicking to the one on one&#044; Tom's misdirected kick is sent down the other end where Tipungwuti finishes classily from 25! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:51)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Watson soccer proves decisive as a fifty-fifty ball works it the Bombers way and eventually the pill lands in Langford's arms. Kyle slots it from 30 on the slight! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Tipungwuti pounds away with that trademark electric pace. Anthony flicks off to Langford&#044; but Kyle can't find the finish from 45 on the run. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:09)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Lions win the stoppage via the dominant Martin and Hipwood takes the contested grab opposed to Hartley. Eric's reach won him that mark&#044; but the kick misses from 55 out. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Colyer&#044; Tipungwuti and Anthony then picked out the leading Fantasia ahead of Gardiner. Orazio lines up for his fourth from 40 and sends it through for a Bombers lead! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:23)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Robinson takes the advantage after Barrett has his legs taken out. Mitch immediately sends the pill for home but misses to the left hand side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Lester darts the pill inside 50 and Hipwood leads Hartley a merry dance to take the mark out on the lead. Eric lines up from the sharp angle on the 50 and sends it through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 0:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Merrett misses the target moving through the corridor. Martin forces the turnover with the physical pressure and Zorko takes advantage&#044; slamming it through before the siren! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 31:55)</span><br />
