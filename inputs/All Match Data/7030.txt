#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Duursma shoots on the run from long range and misses.

SPP gives the one-two with Rozee before dishing by hand to Motlop who ices the cake with a 35m running goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:46)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Butters collects at the intersection of the 50 and the boundary line&#044; takes three bounces&#044; then checksides a classy&#044; composed goal from just outside the goalsquare. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:24)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Eddie Betts works it out the back to Murphy who launches a high kick toward goal that can't quite sneak through. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:25)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: It's Greenwood&#044; Douglas&#044; and then Milera who marks on the lead 35m out&#044; smack in front. Wayne's shot hits the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:39)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Luke Brown is penalised for holding Ebert in a marking contest&#044; allowing Brad to kick from 35m&#044; directly in front&#044; and put a nail in the Adelaide coffin. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:39)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Sam Gray pokes a short kick to Wines just outside the arc. He tries to draw an opponent to release a handball to the runner&#044; but it doesn't eventuate. He snaps from 45 and misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Amon picks up the loose ball just inside 50&#044; sidesteps his opponent and lines up on his left boot from 45m&#044; pulling it to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Duursma powers his way through traffic and throws a snap on the boot toward goal from 45. It bounces wide.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:28)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Duursma launches a shot from the first row of the crowd that has the accuracy but not the distance&#044; punched over centimetres before the goal line. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 1:36)</span><br />
