#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Suban slips over allowing Parker to take the uncontested mark from a Heeney pass. Parker caps off a stellar individual and team performance with with third goal of the day.   <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:21)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Grundy finds McVeigh who marks near the boundary under pressure. From 45m out&#044; his set-shot is flawless. Margin draws out to 98 points. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:57)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: It's deja vu with Hewett finding Tippett in an almost identical position. He plays on this time and hits Franklin on the lead. Buddy misses to the narrow side from 35m with angle.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: With the outstretched dukes&#044; Tippett marks a Hewett pass 40m out on a 45 degree angle. He kicks his second for the day and the Swans are approaching the 100 point margin. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: McVeigh bravely attemps a mark but the ball spills out. Towers picks it up&#044; hands to Hayward&#044; who snaps truly from 25. Another goal for the Swans. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Fyfe streams out of the centre circle and launches a flying shot from 60. It bounces through for a behind.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Fyfe&#044; Hill&#044; then a mark or free kick - take your pick - to McCarthy against Melican. Cam slots the relatively straightforward shot from 30m out for his second. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:10)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Franklin will line up for goal number 5 of the afternoon thanks to a free kick for a Hamling push-out. His kick from 45 narrowly misses. His first minor score of the day.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: McVeigh spots Zak Jones in the forward 50 among other options. With a grin&#044; Zak Jones somehow wobbles an absolute mongrel kick through the big sticks for a goal.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A high-roving Franklin hits up Hayward in open space. From 40m out with no significant angle&#044; he just misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:05)</span><br />
