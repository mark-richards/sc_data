#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Melbourne win it by a point! With seconds on the clock&#044; Tom McDonald almost squanders his chance but manages to soccer the footy into the post. It wasn't pretty&#044; but what a finish. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Scores are level again! Hunt swoops and shows true composure to set up Marty Hore from 50m. Will we have a draw? <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 31:49)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Nick Holman kicks what looks to be the matchwinner with less than a minute to go! The Suns go 6 points ahead with 47 seconds left. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:19)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Garlett provides pressure on the flank before centering the footy to the hot spot. Hunt crumbs and gives to Harmes but his quick snap is offline. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A poor Melbourne handball allows the Suns to counter-attack from half back. Corbett marks the Swallow kick and has no problem slotting the goal from 30m. Suns hit the front! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:13)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Oliver hacks it out of a stoppage&#044; forward of the wing. Tom McDonald protects the dropzone and snags the contested mark in front of Collins. His 40m shot hits the behind post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:51)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Will Powell provides the quick response thanks to a clinical handball from Ainsworth to force the footy to a dangerous area. 5 points the margin.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:21)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Jones clears the footy from the stoppage&#044; centering from the flank to the corridor. Tom McDonald is able to get rid of Collins to take the mark&#044; kicking his third of the day. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Lukosius provides the contest to bring the ball to ground in the hot spot. MacPherson roves and passes by hand to Holman who wheels around on his left. Goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Harbrow runs his full measure out of defence before kicking straight to Sam Frost. The defender's 55m set shot sails through for a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:57)</span><br />
