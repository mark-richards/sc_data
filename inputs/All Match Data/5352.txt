#####<em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: The helmeted young man Caleb Daniel gets himself a goal from a mark 40 out and then gets himself another shot after a pass from Hunter lets him mark and goal from 30!  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:04)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Daniher marks next to the boundary post and goes back to Jack Merrett 35 out in a better position&#044; but his shot is wildly out on the full. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:21)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Crameri's seventh was probably the best of the bunch (so far) as his run through the middle of the ground before the shot from 60 was brilliant. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Melksham snaps around the body at goal from 15 out&#044; but it knicks the post on the way through. All this does is allow the Dogs to go forward and Crameri kicks his seventh! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:19)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Tory Dickson gets himself a fourth goal after a marking encroachment allows him to get within striking distance after a 50 metre penalty. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Daniher marks strongly against Morris just outside the 50 and pops the ball over to Ambrose in a slightly better position. From 45 with a 45 degree angle he misses to the right. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Daniher kicks the first of the last term&#044; gathering the ball after a high kick into the pocket from Jack Merrett and dodging a player in the goalsquare. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 1:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Boyd uses his run to wheel around Gwilt on the boundary outside 50 and deliver inside where Stringer just out works Hibberd to gather and run past for an easy fourth goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 27:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Gleeson fires a handpass to a team mate in the defensive 50 but it hits nothing but shins&#044; allowing Johannison to sprint past with the pickup and goal from 45. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 25:36)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: The Dogs look to turn this into an ugly thrashing as they work it out of the middle with ease to Dickson 35 out from goal. The guy doesn't miss&#044; and this shot is no different. Goal <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 22:11)</span><br />
