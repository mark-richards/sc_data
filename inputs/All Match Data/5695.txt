#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Tippett picks out Parker inside 50&#044; allowing the on-baller to mark unopposed. Luke lines up&#044; boundary side&#044; 40 out&#044; and he provides a spectacular moment with a classic finish! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:54)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Kennedy wins it at the coalface and goes long to the Kolodjashnij/Heeney contest. Isaac takes a tremendous contested grab and makes no mistake from directly in front&#044; 20 out! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:34)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Miller spots Matera inside 50 and McVeigh clips him late&#044; providing the 50 metre penalty for his Suns counterpart. From dead in front&#044; point blank range&#044; Brandon goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Swans speed it from end to end&#044; and it enables Hannebery to bring it to ground and then fend off competitors as Rohan swoops. Gary made no mistake via the snap from 20! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: It appears to be touched on the line. The umpires call was a minor score and thus the decision was inconclusive&#044; allowing for the minor score to be paid. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 21:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Swans co-captain in Kieran Jack chips it over the top to Rose&#044; allowing James to mark unopposed. From 40 on the flank&#044; James kicks and a goal review has been called for... <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 20:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Brooksby takes McGlynn high in the attempted tackle and the decision is paid&#044; before Ben chips it short to the unmarked Jack. Kieran marks and goals from 35 on the slight! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 17:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Swans win it at the stoppage and McGlynn is the recipient. Ben flicks it off to a charging Lance&#044; but he misses the open play shot with a bouncing attempt from 60. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 15:09)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Mitchell slots a nice major in his fiftieth game! Prestia was unable to hold onto May's flick pass&#044; allowing Tom to gather&#044; settle and snap truly from the forward pocket! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 13:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hannebery to Jack to Franklin through the middle of Metricon&#044; all by foot before Lance marked 45 out on the slight angle. Brilliant running by the former Hawk&#044; but he misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 12:55)</span><br />
