#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Melksham eventually puts a full stop to proceedings with another goal from outside CHF. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Bruce loses the footy trying to bounce into goal in the pocket&#044; looks like he stuffed up a certain goal but Sinclair mops up and grubbers home from 20m. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Neal-Bullen gives to Harmes who hits the post on the run from 45m on a slight angle. But enough time has elapsed&#044; this one is done. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: 4:32 left at the kick in&#044; four kicks in it. Highly unlikely. But this is 2017! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:37)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Geary passes to Pedersen just inside 50m on the flank. The set shot drifts to the behind line... Gawn marks and goes to Weideman 30m out on the flank for a miss. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Membrey gives to Billings who snaps OOTF under pressure from the pocket. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: 8:49 left&#044; momentum with Melbourne and good teams win from here. Have the Saints got anything left? <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Hannan flies in front of Webster to take a contested grab at much the same position. He repeats the dose! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Credit to Jetta for riding a tackle to win that loose footy. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Vince passes short to Hannan 40m out on the flank after Geary halves a contest with Garlett. Hannan's set shot looks a bit rightish but straightens for a big goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:20)</span><br />
