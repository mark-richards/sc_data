#####<em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Curnow puts through a consolation goal after working hard for the Blues all night. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:51)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: McGovern kicks a high snap from 40 out but it bangs into the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:35)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Fogarty marks 45 out on the flank. His set shot falls short and McGovern receives a dubious free kick for a block against Phillips. He snaps his fifth of the night. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:44)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Wright marks 40 out on the flank. His set shot splits the middle as the Blues try to repair an unflattering margin. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:06)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Carlton go inside 50 and make a meal of it. Eventually Cripps is able to mark a Graham kick 20 out directly in front. His set shot is a shocker and hits the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:51)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Seedsman roves the throw in on his attacking 50 and takes a long shot from a tight angle. His shot drifts back but hits the post.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:19)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Douglas goes to the fat side to find Jacobs on the lead in front of Thomas. From 30 out on the flank he misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Greenwood beats 2 Carlton players in the pocket to bring the ball to ground. He feeds it out to Mackay who snaps from 15 out to add another goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Petrevski-Seton kicks it forward into the pocket. Carlton players push it toward goal&#044; trying to find a chance but Adelaide allows it through for a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: A long ball is sent toward the Blues' goal. Doedee slips over on the last line and the ball bounces in the opposite direction just crossing the line for a goal! Oops! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:49)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Following a turn over from O'Brien coming out of defence&#044; McGovern marks 40 out against the boundary. He goes back and nails the set shot. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:49)</span><br />
