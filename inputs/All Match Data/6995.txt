#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Zorko catches Sicily HTB and lines up from 45 but his shot is never online. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The Hawthorn defenders fail to get any contact on the footy&#044; allowing Zorko's 70m kick from the centre clearance to bounce over everyone and go through for a goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: After a couple surging soccer kicks&#044; Cameron pops it over the top to Rayner who goes with the Jackie Chan goal line kick. The connection wasn't flush&#044; but it still counts! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:34)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Puopolo kicks to the pocket where Lewis juggles the contested mark. His shot&#044; however&#044; isn't a good one.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: McCluggage is involved before Lewy Taylor is able to get a quick shot away from 45. It looks good until Stratton gets a fingernail on it on the goal line. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Puopolo's centering pass is marked strongly by Lewis amidst a cluster of players. He shoots from 30m and slots the relatively easy goal&#044; keeping the Hawks well within contention. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: RIch's defensive clearance is pick off by Shiels with the intercept. A 50m shot on goal fades to the left for a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Hipwood stands tall to get rid of O'Brien and clunk a strong mark off the Robinson entry. From 30m on a 45-degree angle&#044; Eric sneaks it home! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Mathieson marks the Keays kick a fraction of a second before the 3QT siren. He splits the middle to put his squad 7 points up at the final break. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(3 Qtr Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Brisbane's ruckmen combine with the one-two on the wing before Charlie Cameron gets involved on the flank. He shows composure to find Keays who misses from 40m. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(3 Qtr Time)</span><br />
