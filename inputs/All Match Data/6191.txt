#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Dees have to wait on the Eagles result&#044; far from the desired outcome on this afternoon. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Vince receives after Watts worked a high expected scoring opportunity from the boundary. Bernie has a relatively simple chance from 20 unopposed&#044; but misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: 3:36 left as Hibberd streams off the half back flank... <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:25)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hoskin-Elliott flies for the ball whilst Garlett stays at ground. Questionable decision by the out of position small forward. Will drops the mark but recovers and goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:21)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Score review after Hibberd appears to touch the ball through before Kirby makes contact. Review complete and a minor is the outcome. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: An incomprehensible sequence of events. Cox takes the intercept mark after Tom McDonald's kick in. Mason shoots from directly in front&#044; 30 out and misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Just under ten minutes left to play. The Dees are within 8&#044; whittling the lead from as high as 41. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:54)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hunt goes out the back and Garlett is the recipient. He finds Melksham and Jake flicks to Pedersen. Cam goals from point blank range! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:21)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Brown receives out of the stoppage and urgently throws it on the boot goalward. The youngster in his fifth game hits the post from 30 on the flank. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:25)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Dees win it from the resultant stoppage and send it inside the arc through Hannan. Melksham leads out and takes the grab ahead of Langdon. Jake converts from 45 on the flank! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:19)</span><br />
