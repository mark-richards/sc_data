#####<em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: McIntosh goes inside 50 toward Martin who out-muscles Greenwood to mark 40 out from goal. He manages a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: McIntosh is pinged for HTB after dragging it in deep in his defensive pocket. Stephenson takes the kick and puts it across the face for a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Martin has his kick out of defence smothered. The ball is turned over and Hoskin-Elliott marks on the tip of the goal square. He goes back and goals. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:53)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: McIntosh goes long inside 50 with Riewoldt the target. It comes off hands over the back to Rioli who finishes well from 30. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:09)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Brown kicks blindly out of defence and hits Cotchin on the chest. He spots up Edwards 40 out on the flank. His set shot is good. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:49)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Following a clanger from Martin&#044; Thomas spots up Cox 45 out from goal directly in front. His set shot is poor and just registers a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:24)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Pendlebury roves the throw in 30 out from Collingwood's goal. His snap misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Prestia spots up Riewoldt in the pocket who had the luxury of an open forward line to lead into. His shot from 30 out in the pocket is a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Brown coughs up a handball coming out of defence. Richmond go forward again and Baker skies a snap toward goal. It creeps over for a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:29)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Cotchin releases Lambert in the middle of the ground. He goes long to a Martin-Greenwood contest where Martin can outbody his opponent and run into an open goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:08)</span><br />
