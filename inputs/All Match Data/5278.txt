He goes back and slots the major! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: van Berlo squeezed the kick out of extreme traffic&#044; but it goes the wrong side of the post from 30 via the hack kick effort. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Lever turns it over across goal to Danyle Pearce after the options down the field were few and far between.
