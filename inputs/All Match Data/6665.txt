#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: GAME OVER. Kangas keep there season alive with a win&#044; only by the skin of their teeth. Final margin - 3 points. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: HUGE PLAY. Incorrect disposal against Scott Thompson. Cam Rayner takes the shot from 25 out on a 45 degree angle. He runs around for the snap... and misses! 25 seconds left. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: 1 minute left. Lions are getting repeat inside 50s at this stage... <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Hodge is doing everything he can to lift his team late in Q4. Will it be enough? <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Mason Wood needed to drag Andrews towards him but didn't put enough thought into his play. Instead he snaps on the outside of his boot and misses to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Christensen on the boundary has plenty of options to choose from with his kick into the middle. Rayner is the choice&#044; the first choice&#044; and he goals! 4 point ball game! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Robertson&#044; Rich on his left and then a mark to Robinson who'd be pleased with the chance at goal after being thrown into the fence. He's pumped! 10 points the margin with a goal!  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Christensen&#044; Robinson&#044; and then Christensen again. He snaps on his right from 30 out but it bends too far&#044; through for a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:35)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: And that's exactly what they do. Zorko backs his pace and gets around Thompson&#044; centres the ball&#044; where Christensen snaps the ball through the big sticks off the pack. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The BIG O&#044; McInerney can't complete his chance after receiving from Berry. The Lions need to make the most of every opportunity from here in.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:53)</span><br />
