#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Kelly darts the ball to the top of the square as Greene powers into the open space. Toby marks&#044; kicks and goals to complete the victory for the Giants! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 31:10)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Garner slots the consolation prize from 40 out&#044; directly in front as the match reaches its penultimate period. The Roos won a rare stoppage and Taylor took full reward! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Ward sends through another as the Giants begin to push the margin out! Callan works it from the stoppage and sends it through from all of 60 metres! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Poor turnover from North as they attempt to push out of defence once more. Reid takes the intercept mark and slots the major from 35 on the slight angle! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cameron finds Kelly working hard into the forward 50 and Josh completed the play with the mark. The man in demand goes back from 45 on the sharp angle and slots it! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:44)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Taranto reads it off the pack after the Giants win yet another centre clearance. Tim immediately dribbles for goal but misses the opportunity from 45 to the right hand side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:44)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Turner gets out the back and slots through a simple major after a huge collision on the wing between Ziebell and Davis. The pill falls North's way and the rest is history! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Kelly sends it to the top of the square where Cameron and Hansen battle. Reid gets to the contest and manages to soccer it through ahead of his onrushing opponent. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:10)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Roos send it long out the back as Brown heads back to it with Shaw desperate in the chase. The former Pie makes the dive and on video evidence he managed to touch it through. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:57)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Giants switch the pill via Ward's kick. Kennedy flicks it off to Wilson&#044; who bounds his full measure and sends it through with a 55 metre punt! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:10)</span><br />
