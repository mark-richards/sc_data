#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Pendlebury receives the free kick for in the back against Gilbert&#044; a somewhat dubious decision on later inspection. Scott trots in and goals from 35! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Fasolo centres to the hard running Adams as the Pies win a rare centre clearance. Taylor attacks the ball at pace and finishes ahead of a lunging Hickey! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Steven receives Savage's handball and again flicks it off to the speeding Lonie. Jack&#044; being chased down at pace himself&#044; manages to hammer home another! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Grundy fumbles the ball forward and Minchington pounces on the leather&#044; flicking it over the top to Steven. Jack turns and slams it home from point blank range! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Reid wins the one on one at ground level opposed to Fisher. Ben flicks it on to the speeding De Goey&#044; who slots the major from 25! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Fisher centres to Montagna and he finds Armitage&#044; hanging forward and taking the strong mark. From 35 on the slight&#044; David misses to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:39)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Billings receives on the arc and although he's corralled by a spirited Moore effort&#044; Jack manages to send it through the big sticks! The Saints appear home! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:36)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Long bomb comes out of the centre clearance via the boot of Steven and Bruce takes the strong contested mark opposed to Crown. From 30 on the slight&#044; he hits the post again. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:09)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Pendlebury picks the correct kick under a wealth of pressure through the corridor&#044; setting up the much needed goal. From there&#044; Cloke forced it to ground and Fasolo finished! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:09)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Montagna moves it centrally to Savage&#044; who chips it into an unopposed Lonie. From the paint of 50 on the slight angle&#044; he hits the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 1:53)</span><br />
