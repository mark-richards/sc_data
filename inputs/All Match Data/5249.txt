#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Giants will enjoy a famous victory over the Hawks! They worked harder for longer and are more than deserving of the 4 points! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Breust takes it out of the congestion and has a quick snap&#044; but he misses from 35 on the snap from directly in front. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 32:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Duryea finds Gunston on the lead ahead of the desperate challenge by Kennedy. He goes back and lines up 50 metres out on the boundary side&#044; but he misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 32:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: 2 and a half minutes remaining&#044; 2 kick ball game. The Giants are standing strong at this moment in time. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:09)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Birchall passes wide to Whitecross and in turn finds Duryea with the short pass. 45 out on the flank&#044; Taylor slams it through with 4 and a half minutes remaining.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hawthorn's legs look utterly gone. Weak effort by a few of the players chasing there. The match is the Giants to lose now. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hawthorn turn it over from the kick in again! The Giants work it forward and it gets out to Smith&#044; who goals from the snap&#044; 25 out! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Smith turns it over straight to Shaw. He immediately unloads from 55 but he misses to the left hand side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Shoenmakers gives away the free kick for late&#044; front on contact against Cameron. From 35 on the slight angle&#044; Jeremy has his seventh and it's an 11 point ball game! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:23)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Another minor&#044; this time touched through&#044; and the Giants are extending the lead one by one. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Mumford now has a chance. He runs through to 40&#044; but he misses to the left hand side from the open play chance. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:17)</span><br />
