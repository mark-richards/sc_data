#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Harmes is called for a throw and Barlow will be the recipient of the free kick. Michael trots in and sends it through from 30 on the slight angle! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 32:36)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Garlett gathers out the back but Saad was able to delay the inevitable&#044; forcing Garlett to drop the mark. Jeff gathers and snaps truly for his fourth of the term! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:41)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Lynch takes the predictable contested mark opposed to Lewis in a mismatch of sorts. The Suns captain shoots from 45 out&#044; directly in front&#044; and he goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:46)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Watts gathers off the deck and flicks in board to the hard running Tyson. Dom receives and sends it through with ease from 40 on the slight angle! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hibberd powers away off the wing and finds Garlett on the lead ahead of Saad. Jeff shoots from 45 on the flank and misses to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:41)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: That play was akin to a training drill. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:06)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hannan&#044; Pedersen&#044; Bugg&#044; Watts and Jones  linkup inside the forward 50 as the Suns scramble to pressure their opponents. Nathan hammers it through from close range! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:06)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Matera has his third of the afternoon after Hunt gave away the 50 metre penalty for encroaching the mark. Brandon finishes truly from 45 on the flank! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:41)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: One way traffic if ever you've seen it now. Oliver with a flashy handball out of the middle and the Dees waltz it forward. However&#044; Bugg was unable to finish from 45. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Leslie turns it over by hand in the thick of congestion and Viney is the recipient&#044; darting the effort to Garlett on the lead ahead of Saad. Jeff kicks his fourth from 30! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:40)</span><br />
