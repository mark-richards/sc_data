#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Ablett sends it forward from the clearance where Rohan marks at speed on his chest. The 45m attempt starts online but fades late.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Dangerfield marks 40m out&#044; kicking his fourth of the day to cap off an influential performance that's all but guaranteed the three votes.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Fisher releases the galloping Walsh who sets sail from 45&#044; chalking up a late goal for the Blues. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Dangerfield sends it inside 50 to Blicavs who's drifted forward. The shot is reminiscent of a defender&#044; slicing it OOTF.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The under-pressure Bews kick lands in the lap of Narkle at 40&#044; but he can't make the most of the chance.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Dahlhaus makes it three for the afternoon&#044; roving the throw-in splendidly and snapping off a couple of steps from 25. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Grunt work from Narkle allows Miers to finally chalks up a major&#044; sending a snap from 35 on his left that narrowly sails over the players on the goalline.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Ablett pumps it out from the centre. Ratugolea makes the contest&#044; bringing the ball decisively to ground&#044; allowing Dahlhaus to crumb cleanly at speed and split the middle.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: McGovern scoops it out the back to Fisher who throws a snap on the boot that sails through from 30. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A chain of rapid handballs ends with Kelly at 25 who shoots on the run but misses to the near side.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:36)</span><br />
