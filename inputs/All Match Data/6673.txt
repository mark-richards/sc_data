#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: O'Meara kicks the goal! Hawks go 12 points up with 57 seconds on the clock.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Menegola marks strongly at half forward. He looks up and kicks in the direction of Hawkins who marks over his opponent. From 30 on a slight angle&#044; Tom misses! One goal the margin. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Selwood bombs it forward from the wing and somehow Parsons takes the mark. He's had a quiet day but this kick is massive. From 45&#044; he misses. 7 points the margin. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Narkle bulls through his opponent and handballs into space to Duncan. Mitch dishes to Kelly who goals from 25m on the run. Game on! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:23)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Ricky Henderson is pinged for a deliberate rushed behind&#044; making no effort to keep the ball in play. Menzel snaps from the pocket on his right and goals! Back to 14 points! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Blicavs finds Henry who is one of the only free men in their attacking half. Henry's kick from 50 to the hot spot gets the lucky bounce as is through for a goal! 20 point margin. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:04)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Gary Ablett almost pulls something out of nothing with a quick snap&#044; but it's just wide of the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:23)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Poppy catches Tuohy HTB in the forward pocket with a pinned arm. Electing for the drop punt from the socket&#044; his shot is across the face and no score.   <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:04)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Henry will kick for goal after the 3QT siren. Dangerfield cleared the footy inboard where Scott Selwood found Henry. His shot was lucky to get through for a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(3 Qtr Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Mitchell bombs it on his right foot high and hopeful into the 50. Gunston flies&#044; it falls to Puopolo. He snaps from the pocket and misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 27:24)</span><br />
