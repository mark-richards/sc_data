#####<em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Geelong win by three points! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: 45 seconds remaining&#044; Pedersen kicks to the hot spot where Gawn reaches high and marks! His set shot from 25m out directly in front misses! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: 2 minutes remaining&#044; 4 point advantage to Geelong. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Gawn fumbles a mark in the goal square&#044; gathers his own crumb&#044; snaps at goal but misses to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Parfitt goes kicks long to Menzel in the goal square and Menzel is too good for Wagner&#044; taking the mark above his head. Amazingly&#044; Menzel misses the set shot from point blank range <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Garlett pushes Tuohy out and marks 45m out.

The angle doesn't bother him though as he goes back and slots his fourth. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:25)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Vince through the middle of the ground kicks low inside 50 where Petracca marks strongly overhead 40m out on a slight angle. Petracca's set shot misses to the right. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 28:57)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Long ball into the Geelong forward line 30m from goal is crumbed by Menzel who snaps a nice goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 26:59)</span><br />
