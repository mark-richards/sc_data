#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Dumont gives the Roos the smallest of sniffs with a quality snap goal from 30. Two minutes left.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The big Hawks combine as Ceglar launches a high inside-50 that McEvoy marks brilliantly above a cluster of players. His 35m kick slides to the right for a minor score.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Scott finds space where there wasn't much and then kicks in the Ziebell direction. The Roos' skipper is too strong for Impey. He marks and plays on&#044; kicking the simplest of goals. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: 50m is paid against Pittard for entering the protected space around Breust. It brings Breust into scoring range and his 35m set shot makes the Kangaroos pay. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: After a sidestep and a left foot snap&#044; Hawks fans rejoice as their boom recruit Chad Wingard kicks another goal. Without momentum&#044; it's looking tougher for North now. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:36)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: It's back to back goals for Hawthorn&#044; this time thanks to a classy McEvoy snap from 40. Gunston and Nash were involved in the lead-up.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:28)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Breust swoops on the loose ball at the HFF stoppage and bullets the footy through the big sticks. The Hawks take their lead out to 9 points.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Aaron Hall roves the Sicily/Brown contest in the hot spot and has absolutely no trouble to swing onto his left boot and snap the goal from the pocket. 3 points the margin!  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The Hawks work the footy quickly down the wing&#044; eventually falling into the hands of Cousins. His flying shot from 45 on a slight angle is offline <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:44)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Dumont fumbles which allows Smith to mop up and pass on his right to Wingard in the pocket. On the better side for a left-footer&#044; Chad splits the middle and doesn't he love it! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:25)</span><br />
