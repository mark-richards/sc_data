#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Siren! Close&#044; tough game today in Ballarat. Well done Bulldogs. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Dahlhaus's long-range flying bomb almost ices the game&#044; but it bounces the wrong side of the post. 1.20 remaining&#044; Dogs up by 9. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:46)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The big names combine in Macrae and Hunter. Lachie lines up his shot from just inside the 50 on a slight angle. It's away to the right for another behind. 2.55 left. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: McLean intercepts a Suns' handball&#044; then finds it himself and passes to the galloping Suckling. From 50&#044; his shot is left. Handy point. Lead out to 7.  Only 3.46 left <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Richards pushes Martin in the back at 40m on a 45 degree angle. He's kicked well all day and this is no exception. Goal to Jack Martin! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:54)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Boyd slices a kick that conveniently falls to Williams&#044; streaming forward. He runs from 55 to 45 and kicks it straight through the big sticks! The Dogs fans starting to find voice. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:19)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: English is strong in the contest and although he deson't mark&#044; he brings the footy down to a dangerous area. Gowers crumbs&#044; changes direction and goals from 20m out. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:34)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Gowers elected not to shoot&#044; passing backwards to Wallis&#044; again backwards to Suckling who snaps a banana from 40&#044; It's not&#044; but slightly left. Scores level again.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Ainsworth rushes a snap shot from the boundary amidst congestion&#044; through for a minor score. It's enough to put the Suns in the lead with 9 minutes to go. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Macrae was completely blindsided by Aaron Young&#044; running straight into the Sun 20m out for a HTB free kick. Young splits the middle. Scores level again! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:20)</span><br />
