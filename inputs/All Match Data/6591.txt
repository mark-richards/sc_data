#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Hogan dives for the mark and will shoot after the siren. He misses from 45m. Gave over. It's a grand old flag. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Gawn disguises a set-shot turning into a hot spot kick. Hogan marks running toward goal. He goals yet again. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Jordan Lewis turns it over to Roughead who marks at 50. Suckling does what he does best&#044; receives the handball&#044; and roosting a massive goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Dahlhaus marks strongly then finds Lipinski in the pocket. He opts for Honeychurch on a lesser angle. From 40&#044; Mitch misses right. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Spargo unselfishly passes to Brayshaw&#044; who has enough time to slip over&#044; get up and still kick the goal from the goalsquare.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Neal-Bullen isn't confidence with the distance&#044; aiming for Melksham instead. He centres to McDonald who kicks his fourth. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A soft as you'll see 50m against Salem for 'dropping' the ball brings Roarke Smith into range. His shot doesn't make the distance. OOB. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:04)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Melksham goes again&#044; this time a play-on shot from 50. It makes the distance&#044; but misses left. Hogan isn't too happy with that choice.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Tom McDonald elects not to give to Brayshaw&#044; instead going for Melksham. Jake snaps on his left from 30 but it's just wide. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Gawn does the roving of a hot-spot pack with a handball to Hogan.He weights up his options&#044; elects to shoot&#044; and slots the middle. Melbourne extend their lead. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:17)</span><br />
