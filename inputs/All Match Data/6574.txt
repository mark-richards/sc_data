#####<em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Brown puts a high ball inside 50 where Wood comes back with the flight to take a brave mark.

His quick shot from 40 is a goal! That might just put it beyond reach for the Giants. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: The Giants work it down the wing with some inch perfect handballs. A quick kick goes inside 50 where Cameron tries a snap with his back to goal.
