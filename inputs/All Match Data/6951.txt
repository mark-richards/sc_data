#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A sliding Greene takes the mark in the GWS forward pocket. Electing for the drop punt&#044; Toby hits the post.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A hasty roving snap out of a congested pack sails over the goal umpire's head. Goal to Jordan Dawson! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:41)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: From 45 on a tight angle&#044; Coniglio slots his fourth goal of the day! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:41)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The Giants forwards sync up through Cameron&#044; Finlayson and then Greene. The latter kicks the right foot snap from the pocket. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:54)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: After the centre clearance&#044; Josh Kennedy smothers&#044; follows up&#044; and throws it on the boot&#044; landing on the chest of Blakey. The youngster kicks truly! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Hopper finds Cameron in space deep in the pocket. On the good side for a left-footer&#044; Jeremy runs inboard&#044; snaps&#044; and goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Call it a mark or a free kick as Heeney lines up for a set shot from 40. On a simple angle&#044; he hangs it out to the right. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Greene offloads by hand to Cameron who snaps over his left shoulder from the hot spot&#044; but misses.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Kelly has time to size up his options from the pocket. With nothing on offer in the corridor&#044; he elects for the magic checkside banana&#044; which he executes flawlessly!  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Greene bullies through a tackler in a show of strength&#044; then mongrels a kick goalward which sneaks in for a major. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:10)</span><br />
