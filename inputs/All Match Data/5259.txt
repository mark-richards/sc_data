#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Mitchell goes long to the Reid/Taylor matchup but it goes all the way. That's Tom's third of the quarter from a step inside 50 on the flank! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:54)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Gregson kicks the consolation goal from 45 out directly in front after marking from the quick clearance. Cory continues to show off that penetrative kick! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:09)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hannebery&#044; Towers&#044; Mitchell and it then ends with Parker&#044; completely unopposed&#044; he waltzes into goal and slams it home from 25! That's his fifth of the day! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Franklin to Grundy who finds Mitchell a kick ahead of the play unopposed. Tom takes the simple mark and from 45 on the flank&#044; Tom slams it home! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:36)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Final verdict is touched. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:13)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Smith finds Parker in short and Luke marks unopposed 45 metres out from goal directly in front. It appears the ball is touched on the line but the review is needed... <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Goodes to Towers and back again before the veteran centres by hand to the hard running Rohan. Gary grabs the pill and has no issue from point blank range! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Jetta grabs the ball just forward of centre and sets the crowd alight with extreme speed to burst away. He runs through to 45&#044; but the shot misses to the left hand side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:10)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Reid goes long to the Franklin/Lonergan matchup and Lance gets it to ground&#044; spins into space and then slams it home! Tremendous work from Franklin! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Mitchell goes once and then again&#044; eventually feeding it out to McVeigh. Jarrad goes for home on the snap from 40&#044; and the connection is perfection. The review is used... Goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:44)</span><br />
