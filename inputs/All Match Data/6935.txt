#####<em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: 10 seconds remaining&#044; Bowes picks up the loose ball&#044; throws the ball on the boot and it bounces through! Suns by 2 points! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Curnow has an opportunity to snap on his left 25m out but leaves it to the left. The door is still open for GC&#044; with 2:30 remaining. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: High&#044; floating ball into the Carlton forward line and Cripps reads it best&#044; marking 30m from goal. He goes back and kicks truly. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Holman wins a free after O'Brien held onto a tackle for too long. Holman takes a set shot from 45m and kicks the goal to put the Suns ahead! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:08)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Ainsworth marks uncontested 45m from goal. He goes back and kicks truly&#044; bringing the Suns to within 4 points. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Walsh marks outside 50 and chips inside to Dow who marks 30m out on a 45 degree angle. He misses to the right. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 24:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Dow feeds out a handball to Cripps who snaps on his right from 30m out and kicks another goal for Carlton. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 8:23)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Walsh stands under a high ball and marks as Witts cleans him up in the process. He shoots at goal from 25m out and kicks truly. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 4:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: McGovern does well to take a contested mark at the top of the square. He plays on immediately and goals. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q2 18:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Sexton gathers under no pressure 40m out&#044; wheels onto his right and kicks a nice goal. His opponent&#044; Thomas&#044; was nowhere to be seen. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q2 17:01)</span><br />
