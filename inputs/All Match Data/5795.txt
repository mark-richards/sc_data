#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hopper sends it out the back for Smith&#044; with Devon not having to break stride as he marks the ball at pace. Devon takes a bounce and finishes from 25 on the slight! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:49)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Gibson receives on the fat side and launches to the hotspot with immediacy. Speaking of launching&#044; Majak does just that and pulls down a towering grab. He misses from 40. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cameron gathers on the bounce ahead of the pursuing Tarrant. Jeremy continues on at pace and snaps back&#044; but misses to the near side under physical duress. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:14)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Williams turns it over under duress as the Giants attempt to feed it away from defensive 50. The Roos pounce and move it off to Cunnington&#044; who goals from 35 on the slight! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Ward takes the contested grab up on the half forward flank. He pushes back quickly and assesses the options&#044; picking out Kelly unmarked. Josh misses the resultant shot from 45. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Scully&#044; Lobb&#044; Davis and then Patton&#044; as the inform man marks strongly on the lead ahead of Firrito. Jonathon kicks from 40 on the flank and misses to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:08)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Haynes gives away the free kick for holding Daw off the ball as the Roos win it directly from the centre stoppage. Majak thumps it from outside 50 and through it sails! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Johnson again plays the role of predator&#044; lurking around the pack and waiting for the pill to fall his way. That it does and Steve nabs his fourth of the night from close range! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:34)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Lobb goes long to the top of the square and Hansen gives away the free kick for holding on Patton. The inform man nabs his fifth of the night and eleventh of the fortnight! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:34)</span><br />
