#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Fantastic victory for the Dees&#044; holding on to win by 8 points in a match which was largely led by the Blues. This win sends the Melbourne footy club into the top four. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Neal-Bullen soaked up thirty seconds from the clock and then passed to Lewis&#044; effectively sealing the win. Jordan goals post siren from 40! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Petracca gathers at ground level and finds Neal-Bullen unmarked inside forty. This resulted from a miraculous Jetta play across half back. Alex passes short to Lewis. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: 1:48 as the Dees force another forward fifty stoppage with Garlett producing the tackle on Murphy. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: 2:02 left to play as the Dees force it forward. Weitering taps the ball over with McDonald hot on his hammer.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:37)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Docherty had the opportunity to send it through but Jetta forced the turnover with the tackle. The play results in a forward half stoppage. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: 3:22 left to play. Stoppage in the centre of the ground and the Blues surge forward through Murphy... <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Melbourne football club hit the lead once more. The besieged defence finally find a gap forward of the contest. Hogan flicks to Melksham who sends it through from 45! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Curnow forces the turnover with a strong tackle and immediately sends the ball to the hotspot. Casboult flies and takes the strong grab. He shoots from 50 on the flank and misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:29)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Wright launches to the hotspot and Docherty floats forward and expertly roves the forward pocket crumbs. The former Lion dribbles the snap for a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:39)</span><br />
