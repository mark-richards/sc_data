#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Rockliff wins the pill from the resultant stoppage and sends it long to the Close/Westhoff matchup and Michael receives the free. He shoots post-siren and misses from 45. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cutler grabs a late consolation prize for the besieged Lions. Robinson forces the turnover with a strong tackle on Jonas. Tom gathers the scraps and bounces it through from 55! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:44)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hartlett darts the kick to the leading Dixon who marks well ahead of McStay. Charlie shoots from 45 on the flank and pulls it to the far side. Dixon's 16th score involvement. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Wines assesses the options with time on his side before feeding it out to Polec. Jared lines it up from 45 but misses with his punt thumping into the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Martin dabs it over the top to the speeding Zorko. Dayne gathers the bouncing pill&#044; sells some candy on Jonas and slots it on the spin from the top of the square! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Gray of the Sam variety powers off the wing as the Lions begin to fatigue&#044; having chased their opponents all day. Sam waltzes past the arc and finishes truly from 40 on the slight! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Robbie Gray attempts the party trick from deep in the pocket via the soccer effort. His kick spins off the deck and onto the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Wingard provides another score assist&#044; this time darting the pass onto the chest of the leading Gray. Robbie shoots but misses to the near side from 25 on the sharp angle. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Wingard fires it out of the centre of the Gabba and finds Dixon on the hard lead. The former Sun shoots for his fourth of the afternoon and he splits the middle from 35! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Robinson takes it directly out of the forward 50 stoppage and immediately snaps on his left boot.He swings it through and celebrates accordingly&#044; apparently unaware of the deficit. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:17)</span><br />
