#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Burgess' clearing kick is only as far as Witherden. He lets loose from 55 but it's narrowly wide.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:29)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Advantage is paid as Day marks the Hanley kick&#044; 35m out. He goes back and squeezes it home.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Brisbane surge through the middle in numbers with Lyons the last link in the chain who shoots from 45 on the run and misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Ainsworth marks the hasty Harbrow kick 40m out and his shot is flawless. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Rich sends a penetrating kick inside 50 from the centre of the ground. McStay pushes Ballard out legally&#044; marks and then plays on to kick the easiest of goals.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Swallow catches Answerth HTB and will go back from 50m. His set shot scrapes over the players on the line&#044; notching up 6 points and bringing the margin back into double figures. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Cameron brings the ball to ground where Zorko swoops front and centre&#044; snapping accurately on the run from 45.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Bowes sells some candy and releases Sexton who trots toward goal and slots the checkside for a rare GC major.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:04)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Martin grabs it out of the ruck against Witts&#044; throws it on the boot&#044; and puts the lions over 100 points up. This is getting nasty.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: McStay stays down at the front of the pack which proves to be a smart choice. The footy falls into his lap and he snaps off one step to slot it from 25.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:29)</span><br />
