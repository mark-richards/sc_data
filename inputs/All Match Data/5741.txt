#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Sidebottom to Adams out of the stoppage&#044; with the former Giant then darting in a pass to the leading Howe. From the set shot&#044; the 50 metre effort misses to the far side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:25)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cameron takes a lead up mark as the Crows spread it down the wing. Charlie lines up from the 50 sign on the arc and sends it through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:25)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cloke makes it his second of the night from point blank range as the big man takes a consolation prize in junk time. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Crows flow forward once more&#044; and this time Betts plays the role of distributor&#044; feeding it off to the powering Lyons. Jarryd receives&#044; settles and goals from 45! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Crisp has a flying shot for goal from 40 after the Pies won the quick centre clearance. Jack sends it goalward but pulls it poorly from the slight angle&#044; providing a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Pies pump it long as they go searching for one last surge. Greenwood times his run perfectly&#044; getting out the back&#044; grabbing the pill off the deck and finishing with ease! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:49)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Smith takes the strong intercept mark as the Pies struggle to rebound out of defence. Brodie flicks it off to the speeding Atkins&#044; who avoids the tackle and goals from 40! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:25)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Jenkins takes the strong contested mark opposed to Reid as the Crows win yet another centre clearance. Lining up from outside 50&#044; Josh misses to the left hand side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 1:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Right before the quarter time siren&#044; Eddie flies and Eddie takes it! Who else? Ahead of Smith he flew&#044; and the former Blue slots his third from 30 on the slight! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 29:13)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Deep in the pocket&#044; McGovern slots the major with the brilliantly executed snap shot off his preferred right peg! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 23:51)</span><br />
