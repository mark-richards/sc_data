Jack flicks it off to Watts&#044; who steadies and snaps for goal from 35.

The former Pie picked out Kent&#044; and Dean finishes with ease from 30! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 29:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Garlett leads the foot race but can only tap it in front of him&#044; and the pace sends it through for a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 28:53)</span><br />
