#####<em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: The Cats go down the guts with a stab pass from Menegola hitting a leading Hawkins on the chest. From 50 out he misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Parfitt tries to evade his Suns opponent next to the behind post. He gets caught and his handball back is gathered by Menegola. He manages to finish with a nice snap. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:14)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: The air has gone out of this one with a ball inside from Selwood missing the target. Cunico has plenty of time to recover and he misses from 40. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Tuohy spots up Buzza on the lead 40 out from goal. His set shot whacks into the woodwork. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: The Suns work it well from a stoppage in their attacking pocket. It ends with Ballard who misses a snap from 40. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: McCarthy tries to roll one through from the boundary under heavy pressure. It gets rushed through by Thompson. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Dangerfield and Ah Chee collide heavily in a contest and Ablett roves the footy. He gets caught but receives a free kick for a trip against Swallow. From 40 out he kicks another. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:46)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Kelly is getting very busy&#044; this time getting the one-two from Duncan. He then dishes off to Ablett who runs down the flank and roosts one through from the 50 arc! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Stanley receives a free kick in the centre for a block. He goes inside 50 and it comes off hands to Kelly. Without breaking stride he roves and snaps a fantastic goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 1:28)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Miller bursts through a stoppage in the Suns pocket. He gathers cleanly and pops it through for a goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 29:14)</span><br />
