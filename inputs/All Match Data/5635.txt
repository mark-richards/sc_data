#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Viney finds Gawn on the short lead&#044; and Max marks with ease as the Demons are well and truly home. The 208cm tall Gawn&#044; trots in and finishes it off with an excellent finish! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Kent finds Hogan with a quality central delivery&#044; allowing Jesse time to mark and assess his options. That he does&#044; finding Jones in acres of space. From the shot&#044; he hooks it. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hogan manages to keep the ball ahead of him and hold his feet whilst Adams struggles on behind. Jesse gathers&#044; but his shot just misses from 35 to the left hand side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:34)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Treloar booms it long to the top of the square where Howe attempts an almighty fly&#044; bringing the pill to ground. Fasolo waits on the deck and snaps truly when the chance presents! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Bugg hammers it within the vicinity of the Frost/Reid matchup and Sam takes a diving mark. He handballs centrally to Tyson&#044; who goals from close range! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Treloar finds it in traffic after the Dees made a poor attempt of whacking it out of their defensive 50. Adam flicks it over the top to an eagerly waiting Sidebottom. He goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 26:25)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Moore takes the strong mark opposed to McDonald&#044; holding his feet when his opponent was unable to. Darcy trots in from 35 on the flank&#044; and the 20 year old hits the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 23:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: De Goey waits outside of congestion and receives in space. Jordan has time to steady&#044; but his effort misses to the right hand side from 35 on the across the body effort. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 21:23)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Viney extends the margin further with a maximum. The Pies turn it over through the middle of the ground. Jones is the recipient and they spread it forward to an easy shot for Jack! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 18:13)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Dees make it back to back goals! Frost finds it on the ground after the Kennedy long bomb. Sam flicks it off to Pederson&#044; and Cam goals from the pocket! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 14:25)</span><br />
