#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Rioli takes a huge contested mark and will shoot after the siren for some icing on the cake. He nails it before the Richmond anthem starts to play.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Rioli pounces on a loose ball in the pocket but his snap sails through for a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: McGrath goes inside 50 where Ambrose marks diving to his right. He lines up from 45 but tugs it to the left. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:39)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: It's McGrath&#044; Ambrose and then Merrett with a hasty snap kick toward goal that misses from 40. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Langford collects in the forward 50&#044; offloads to Heppell and then clunks a one-hander off Heppell's boot while running back with the flight. Kyle kicks truly from 30! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Merrett chips a 15m kick to Laverde who will line up from 40. He strikes it beautifully to bring the margin back to four goals.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Bellchambers clunks a strong contested mark and slots the goal from 25m out with ease.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Grimes again denies Essendon with a touch on the goal line&#044; this time off the boot of Merrett from a stoppage. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Richmond bring the footy through the corridor via Caddy and Martin. Higgins' set shot from 45&#044; directly in front&#044; is as good as it gets.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Begley provides the contest to bring the footy to ground inside 50. Langford is first to the loose ball and chalks up another soccer-style goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:47)</span><br />
