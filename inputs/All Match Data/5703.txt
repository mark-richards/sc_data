#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Long bomb into the Roos starved forward line&#044; with Wood managing to out-body Enright and take a strong mark. From 40 on the slight angle&#044; Mason sends it through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:19)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: McCarthy to Duncan who manages to just flick it off whilst copping the Thompson tackle. The pill falls straight into Motlop's pass&#044; who brilliantly soccers it through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Duncan to Kersten and back again&#044; with Mackenzie giving away the dubious free kick for in the back. Lining up from 45 on the flank&#044; Mitch pulls it to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Duncan receives out of congestion and immediately hammers goalward. Mitch's hooking effort from 45 misses to the far side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Dangerfield appears to be involved in the beginning&#044; middle and end of this play. He wins it through the middle&#044; feeds it off and then marks the Motlop inside 50. He goals from 40! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: On further inspection the vision is conclusive and the touched behind is paid. Big moments for the Roos as they still remain a chance in this contest. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The young star Menzel provides a potentially game-splitting play! He read the Mullett pass early&#044; forced the turnover and kicked it through the big sticks... Review time. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:04)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Atley is caught unawares in his defensive 50&#044; with Guthrie providing the quality tackle. The Cats number 29 trots in and misses everything from 40 on the flank. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:29)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Menzel produces an excellent pass after finding a modicum of space to dab a pass to the hardworking Duncan. Mitch kicks from 35 directly in front and goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Gibson sends the high up and under to the hot spot and Wood took a huge contested grab with a fly to remember. Mason kicks after the siren and goals from the acute angle! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 30:21)</span><br />
