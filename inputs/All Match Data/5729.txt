#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: CLoke busts a pack open to take a big grab in trademark style 30m out on a slight angle from an Adams clearance.

Treloar misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Patton marks a Scully ball from the wing to a pack near the hotspot after the first centre bounce of Q4. He kicks truly. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 0:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Cloke stands in front of Shaw and takes an amazingly easy chest mark 20m out in front from a long Moore ball. He doesn't miss this one&#044; the 3QT siren sounds&#044; Pies in control! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 29:01)</span><br />
