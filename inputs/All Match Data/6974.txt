#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Acres turns it over on the wing to Crisp. Jack steps through traffic&#044; kicking to Mihocek who marks on the flank. After the siren&#044; Brody misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Savage kicks to Battle who outmarks Maynard in the hot spot with strength. From about 25&#044; Josh kicks the goal. Too little&#044; too late for the Saints.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:21)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Stephenson launches a mammoth barrel from well outside 50! It puts a smile on Buckley's face as the Pies extend their lead.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:09)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Beams links up with Tom Phillips who pokes it inside 50 into the lap of Hoskin-Elliott. From 35&#044; he misses to the near side.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:39)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Hoskin-Elliott and Sidebottom combine in the pocket&#044; with the latter unselfishly centering to Mihocek. From 25m on a 45-degree angle&#044; Brody splits the middle.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A front and centre Varcoe crumbs a contest in the pocket perfectly&#044; snapping the goal from 25m&#044; directly in front.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:39)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A handful of Pies are involved with consecutive&#044; accurate short passes. Stephenson is the last link in the chain&#044; marking and kicking the goal from 35m.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:24)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Beams is the first to react&#044; intercepting Marsh's hasty clearing kick. From 45m on a slight angle&#044; Dayne hooks it badly.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Mihocek and Varcoe clash mid-air&#044; bringing the ball to the feet of Sidebottom. His 40m snap is just wide. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:09)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Pressure from Young causes Aish's inside-50 attempt to drop short. Sidebottom collects&#044; stepping around Saints brilliantly. He runs at goal&#044; composes himself and slots it from 35. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:00)</span><br />
