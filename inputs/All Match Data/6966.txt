#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Hoskin-Elliott takes a courageous mark running back with the flight. With 5 seconds left&#044; he kicks the goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Weitering needed to pump it down the corridor&#044; but instead went wide&#044; turning it over. Phillips grabs the loose ball&#044; lines up from 48&#044; and goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 31:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Ben Reid forces the ball to ground in a two-on-one&#044; leaving Plowman winded. De Goey is the first to pounce on the ground ball&#044; soccering it through for a crucial goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Mihocek applies great pressures&#044; forcing the ball to spill out of the hot spot. Callum Brown pounces and dribbles a goal from 20m! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: After receiving the 50m penalty&#044; Crisp's intended pass sails over the head of Elliott and Plowman&#044; narrowly avoiding fingertips. It's through for a hugely important goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Kreuzer taps it down to Cripps who launches a quick shot from 35 but it's just wide. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Kreuzer reads the centre bounce and sends it inside 50. Gibbons crumbs the content and offloads to McGovern who kicks the running goal! Blues edge ahead.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A 100m penalty is paid against the Pies for Phillips stepping over the mark and then encroaching on the runner. Cunningham kicks the goal from 15m. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Cripps takes a phenomenal mark on the wing&#044; then pushes forward to get on the end of the play to finish with class from 45. Silvagni's spoil on Langdon was crucial. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A quick-footed Brown snaps toward goal out of congestion. The Sherrin bounces on its point&#044; giving Phillips a huge soccer-style look at it&#044; but he sends it wide.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:11)</span><br />
