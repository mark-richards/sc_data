#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Lycett gifts the Pies another 50 metre penalty&#044; attacking the man with the ball before the play on was called. Travis lines up from 35 and shanks it through for a minor. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:29)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Marsh takes the intercept mark and moves it off quickly&#044; finding Sidebottom unopposed 35 metres out from goal. Steele lines up and sends it through with just 91 seconds to play! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Josh Hill again gets involved as the Eagles find him out the back ahead of his direct opponent in Maynard. Pressure is applied but Josh manages to snap truly from the pocket! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hill throws it on the boot&#044; attempting to find the speeding Tunbridge out the back. The ball takes an incredible bounce in Collingwood's favour&#044; bouncing through for a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:46)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Shuey to Schofield who picks out Kennedy&#044; speeding out the back unmarked with Pendlebury the nearest opponent. Josh kicks from 50 and misses everything! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hill receives at pace and powers inside 50. The former Dog settles on the kick for goal&#044; but misses the sublime chance to cut the margin&#044; providing a minor score from 45. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Gaff wins the clearance and chips it off to Kennedy&#044; who marks once more on the lead opposed to the under-siege Brown. Josh lines up from 40 on the flank and pulls it for a minor. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Maynard takes the terrific intercept grab after McGovern turned it over centrally inside defensive 50. The half back flanker trots in and Brayden sends it through from 50! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Treloar rises to the occasion&#044; with an instinctive high quality finish! From the forward stoppage&#044; he bulled his way to the pill&#044; swung onto the right peg and slammed it through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Maynard provides a skimmer&#044; giving White just enough time to run up and take the grab. Jesse lines up and finishes from 45 on the slight angle! Two in a minute for the Pies! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:00)</span><br />
