#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Bulldogs triumph by 5 points in a win of epic proportions! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Huge call by the umpire to pay deliberate against Short from deep in the forward pocket. Very questionable decision. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: 52 seconds to play with a stoppage on the wing. Dogs lead by 5. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Macrae takes the quick attempt out of the stoppage with less than two and a half minutes to play. His effort misses to the right hand side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Martin&#044; McIntosh and Castagna link. Murphy catches Jason in the tackle and the ball pops loose to Riewoldt. He checks to see if the free is paid before slotting it from 35! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Smith fights for possession inside 50 and beats McIntosh in the contest. He looks centrally and finds Hunter unopposed. Lachie goals from 30 out&#044; directly in front! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Macrae flicks the handball off to the unmarked Johannisen. Jason assesses the option on the HF flank and finds Smith running into F50 unmarked. Clay shoots from 40 and goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:08)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Johannisen streams through the middle and finds Suckling by hand. Matt dabs the pass over the top and Smith marks unopposed at the top of the square. Clay slots it! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Lambert reads it off the Wood punch and Kane has a tremendous opportunity to gain a maximum from 25 on the slight. His dribble effort misses to the wrong side of the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Matt Boyd takes the intercept mark across half forward and finds Johannisen centrally with precision. Jason marks outside 50 and launches from 60&#044; but misses to the left. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:03)</span><br />
