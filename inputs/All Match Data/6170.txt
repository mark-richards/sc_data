#####<em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Breust marks 40m out and hands over the top to Roughead who is able to run into an open goal in his milestone game. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 32:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Long ball to the hotspot of the Hawthorn forward line where Mitchell is the unlikely flyer. He can't take the mark but follows up his own work and kicks a nice goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Richmond hold possession for around a minute and then pump the ball in long through Martin where Nankervis marks above his head 30m out directly in front. He goes back and goals. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:37)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Martin from 50m out does well to find Butler in the pocket. Butler improves the angle and kicks around his body but misses to the far side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Caddy hands to Miles who is running into an open goal but as he considers gifting a handball to Martin is run down by Glass! Comical error. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Sicily kicks long out of defence to a big pack. It spills to Martin who releases Prestia who kicks a long goal from 55m out. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Sicily marks 60m from goal and pumps it in long where Breust is on his own and marks overhead at the top of the goal square. He goals. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:37)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: The Richmond small forwards combine with handball to eventually get it to Caddy on the goal line who kicks the easiest of goals. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:36)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: High ball into the Hawthorn forward line and Ellis looks to mark but Breust comes over the top and takes the grab. Breust from 40m out on a 45 degree angle kicks the goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:46)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Ellis takes an intercept mark 35m out and has a set shot from a slight angle but misses across the face. Poor kick. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 1:32)</span><br />
