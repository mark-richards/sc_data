#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: With 17 seconds on the clock&#044; McDonald-Tipungwuti spins onto his right and kicks an unbelievable goal from deep in the pocket to give the Bombers the lead! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Saad dashes down the wing to spot Laverde in plenty of space on the flank. His kick is offline&#044; bringing the margin back to a solitary point.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Zurhaar lowers his eyes at half forward to hit Ben Brown on the lead. From 50m&#044; he nails his sixth of the day to put North in front! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:08)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Polec's entry is low&#044; hard and into the mitts of Thomas. He lines up and nails it. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Ben Brown marks outstretched above Hooker&#044; however&#044; on a tight angle he can't have his regular run-up. The result? Sprayed OOTF. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Williams smacks it forward from 75&#044; landing with Zurhaar in the pocket. He plays on&#044; runs inboard and snaps&#044; but it barely makes it in for a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:22)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A lack of body contact allows Ben Brown to run and leap at the footy&#044; marking the Thompson entry above a cluster of others. He kicks from 35m flawlessly.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Ziebell launches a long one from outside 50 that's almost held by Ben Browm&#044; but Hooker pressure forces it over the line for a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 1:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Gleeson trots through the corridor and kicks it forward to Langford on Pittard. Kyle shoves his marker under the ball&#044; takes the mark&#044; and slots the easy goal.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 29:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Gleeson blocks Ziebell in the marking contest which gifts North's skipper an eye at goal. His snap lacks accuracy&#044; hugely hooked OOTF. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 26:03)</span><br />
<em style='color:#000'>DarkHorseR</em>: Tarrant was taking a mark every 10sec as the Bombers literally bombed it in the last few minutes.<br><em style='color:#000'>BigChief</em>: Rather the Suns belt them so the Blues fans can argue with the Crows fans :)<br><em style='color:#000;margin-bottom:-2px'><b class="ticon tES"></b> duckky</em>: No way Brown was BOG<br><em style='color:#000'>BigChief</em>: wow 159 from Tarrant.<br><em style='color:#000;margin-bottom:-2px'><b class="ticon tBL"></b> DrSeuss</em>: At least Cunners was tagged.
