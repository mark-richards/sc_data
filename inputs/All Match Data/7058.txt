#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A poor OOTF kick-in from the Demons allows Clark to intercept and link up with Jack Billings&#044; but he can't convert the easy running shot.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Billings goes back with the flight to clunk the Lonie kick in the pocket. On the wrong side for a left-footer&#044; to ice the cake for the Saints&#044; he absolutely nails it! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Hind goes back with nothing but courage and somehow avoids contact&#044; collects the footy on the bounce&#044; and dribbles it through from the top of the square. Saints up by 13. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Ross brilliantly steps through traffic and feeds to Lonie&#044; but Jack's running 40m shot is wide. That could prove to be a handy point. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Marshall slaps the footy back with vigor to Hind who snaps from close range straight into the post. Six points the difference with six minutes on the clock... <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: High contact is paid against Petracca on Long in the Saints' forward pocket. Ben whirls around on his right and snaps truly&#044; taking the lead back. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Brayshaw sends it forward from the wing. Following quick hands from Fritsch and Petty&#044; a running Neal-Bullen makes it count from 35m for the eighth lead change of the match. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:21)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Acres takes a bounce and loads up from long range. It wasn't looking online&#044; but a fist from Jetta makes a minor score a certainty.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Superb work from Hunter Clark at CHF allows Ross to hit up Bruce on the lead. From 45&#044; Josh sneaks it home by a whisker.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:49)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Gresham links up with Sinclair who centres to Lonie with space ahead of Hibberd. Without any angle to contend with&#044; the 40m set shot is as easy as you like for Jack. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:19)</span><br />
