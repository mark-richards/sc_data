#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Sidebottom gets it outside the contest to Treloar. Adam runs through to 40&#044; in a similar vein to his earlier finish&#044; but this time misses the speeding attempt. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: De Goey towels up Jones in a tackle as the Swans attempt to rebound out of defence. From 35 on the sharp angle&#044; Jordan hits the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:53)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Adams turns it over via handball to Heeney. isaac settles on the shot from the flank region&#044; 40 out&#044; but hooks it to the near side for a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Greenwood takes the intercept mark and quickly finds Sidebottom through the corridor. The man on report tonight&#044; trots in and misses to the left hand side from 45. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Pendlebury&#044; Adams and Maynard link up by hand before Brandon whacks the pill from the arc of 50 and sends it through post high. Nice consolation effort from the half back! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:14)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Parker grabs it off the deck and flicks it off to Heeney. Isaac feigns and feigns again before opening up just enough space to get the effective snap away. Very classy major! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Kennedy receives out of congestion&#044; but his quick punt at goal misses to the left hand side from 45. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:23)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Franklin pushes off Frost&#044; then feeds it wide to Kennedy and then off to Papley. From 40 out directly in front&#044; the first gamer nabs another! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:35)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Out of the forward 50 Swans stoppage&#044; Sidebottom misfires a handball to Jones&#044; who takes little time to accept the invitation and whack it on the boot for another major! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:09)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Swans work it forward once more from the centre stoppage&#044; and this time Cunningham is able to capitalise. The speedster ran onto the bouncing pill at pace&#044; finishing from 20! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:39)</span><br />
