#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Hopper ices the cake with a minute left till the final siren. The young Giant showed good composure as he slotted the running goal on a difficult angle. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Hamling gets a little too adventurous with his spoiling attempt, giving away an infringement free to Cameron at almost point blank range. Goal to Cameron and here comes the rain.. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Aidan Corr creeps forward and finds himself within scoring distance after receiving from Cameron. Mark at 35, play on, snap, and just misses right. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Off hands, Griffen crumbs and tumbles a high and hope shot at goal from the pocket. It is punched through for a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Finlayson bombs it forward to where Toby Greene marks brilliantly in a one-on-one against Hamling. Deep in pocket, Greene plays on, runs inside and snaps the goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Bailey Banfield, thanks to a good pickup and dish from Taberner, kicks his first goal in footy! From 45, directly in front on the run, and giving the Dockers a sniff.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Tough contested work from Cerra allows the ball to eventually find Ryan, who hits up Matera open inside 50. The breeze helps it right to left, through for a goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:06)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Toby gets pinged for going over the mark, thinking it wasn't a 15m kick (likely only 10). Blakely benefits from the 50m penalty and from the 50 arc, his shot is off hands. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: While tumbling to the deck, Greene manages to offload a quality handball to a running Lloyd. Daniel snaps on his right from 20 out, sneaking it through for a goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 25:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Hopper gets a similar opportunity, yet again his snap can't quite do the damage Leon Cameron would have hoped for. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 23:04)</span><br />
