#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The final siren sounds and the Eagles stage a remarkable comeback. They win by 12  after overcoming a 33-point deficit.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Betts has a chance on the run on a tough angle but it's OOTF and doesn't register a score. With a minute left&#044; Adelaide would need a miracle. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Shuey kicks it forward from the centre square. The Sherrin might have brushed Ryan's fingertips before falling into the lap of Darling but the mark is paid. He kicks truly from 35! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Shuey and Gaff combine to send it into the West Coast hot spot. It spills out where Allen is able to paddle it over the head of his marker to himself&#044; before running into goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Seedsman collects off the feet of a big pack and dishes to Jones. His flying snap from 40 was never on target&#044; but it does level the scores. Four minutes to go...  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Sloane offloads to Murphy who shoots for goal off one step from 45 but it's just offline.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:54)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The big Eagles combine with Darling&#044; Allen&#044; and Kennedy each taking important marks&#044; the last of which is within range. Josh goes back and splits the middle with his 50m attempt.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:54)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Kelly wobbles a centering pass from the boundary which is good enough to find the mitts of Milera&#044; sliding in for the mark. He goes back and slots it from 45! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:22)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Walker handballs it over the top to Murphy who is able to somehow escape McGovern yet can't convert his quick left-foot snap. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:36)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The footy ricochets off Shuey in the pocket following a throw-in&#044; conveniently into the arms of Cripps. Jamie nails the snap from a tight angle to put the Eagles in front! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:38)</span><br />
