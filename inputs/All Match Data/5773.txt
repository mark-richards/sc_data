#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Robinson takes a terrific mark to take 15 seconds off the clock. Just 20 seconds is left to play as the Lions venture forward! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Rich takes it out of the half forward flank stoppage and launches off that left peg. The shot just misses to the left hand side of the goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:22)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Blues have 2 minutes and 9 seconds to complete the task... <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Rockliff gives away the free kick to Thomas for in the back&#044; and the former Pie will kick from the boundary just 25 metres out from goal. Dale misses to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:46)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Blues send it forward through Jones. Gardiner fists it high and Buckley attempts the soccer from the best part of 40. The bounce goes through for a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:22)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Just under 5 minutes left and the Blues are behind by just 5 points! The comeback appears imminent! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:21)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Jansen launches it outside of defensive 50 but turns it over to Weitering. Jacob analyses the options and chips it to the unmarked Armfield. Dennis goals from 40 on the flank! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:53)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Simpson bullets the low pass into Silvagni&#044; who marks strongly ahead of Hammelmann on the lead. Jack kicks from 45 on the slight and nails it for his third! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Tuohy gets taken in the tackle but manages to chip it out to the eagerly anticipating White. Simon receives and shoots from outside 50&#044; but misses to the left hand side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: A calamity of errors by the Blues forwards as a relatively simple chance directly in front is made rather difficult. Casboult was unable to handle&#044; but it fell to Wright to finish! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:50)</span><br />
