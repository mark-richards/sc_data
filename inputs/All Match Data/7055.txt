#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Scully sends it inside 50. The man in front is Answerth but Gunston is paid the mark in the hot spot nonetheless. In a classic case of footy karma&#044; Jack sprays the kick.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:09)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Despite being well within range&#044; Rich unselfishly chips to Christensen free inside the 50. Bundy lines up for his third from 30m but it starts and finishes right.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:36)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: An under-pressure hack kick from Smith lands OOTF&#044; giving Bailey an eye at the sticks. He centres to the square where the Big O clunks the grab over Ceglar and kicks it with ease. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Through Birchall&#044; McEvoy&#044; Smith and then Hardwick&#044; the Hawks find Scully inside 50. Tom quickly plays on&#044; snaps on his left and curls it home.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Henderson marks deep in the pocket and passes last-second to Birchall who marks. He sneaks a little sack-tap on his old buddy&#044; Hodge while he's at it. Grant's shot hits the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Stratton is penalised for a trip on the galloping Rayner&#044; which despite being arguably accidental was still there. From 35m on a slight angle&#044; Cam can't convert. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Nash passes to the adjacent Henderson whose 45m set shot holds up in the breeze&#044; touched on the line.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:41)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Neale and Zorko combine for the centre clearance with the latter hitting up Hipwood on the lead. From 50 on a 45-degree angle&#044; Eric bangs it home. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:37)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: McCluggage picks the footy off the ground marginally inside the Lions 50 and handballs laterally to Neale who spanks an accurate shot over the goal umpireâ€™s head for a hasty reply. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:06)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Smith sends it inside 50 where Breust is able to unleash a quick and clever handball to Hanrahan in the pocket. He can't collect but works it goalward where Nash soccers it through <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:38)</span><br />
