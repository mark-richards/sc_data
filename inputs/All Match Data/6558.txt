#####<em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Masten goes long to Kennedy who receives a free for a hold against Polec.

He goes long inside 50 where Hutchings receives a free kick for a hold against Ebert. He goes back from 40 and converts. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Sam Gray beautifully gathers a Wines kick on the volley and turns to find Dixon on the lead. His shot from 50 out is just off line. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: A nice kick from Watts finds Ryder running back toward goal. He keeps running with Yeo giving chase. Ryder dishes off to Motlop who finishes from 30! The Power are in with a sniff! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:28)</span><br />
