#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Mills takes an intercept mark and looks to have sealed the game! Siren sounds&#044; Swans get up in a cliffhanger!  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:37)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: A goal the difference&#044; thirty seconds left! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:39)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Buckley grabs it out of the stoppage and throws it on the boot as the contact arrives. The floating ball just goes the wrong side of the post for a minor. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: One minute and fifteen seconds left. Deep in the Blues forward line. Seven points the difference&#044; the Swans will be desperate to hold on. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Papley wins the fifty-fifty through the corridor against Kerridge&#044; and quickly feeds it off to Jack. Kieran launches from 45&#044; but misses the un-pressured opportunity. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:53)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Docherty to Gibbs link up as the Swans again find it difficult to rebound. Bryce launches from outside 50 on the sharp angle&#044; and misses to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:24)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Wright powers away as the Swans again have difficulty evacuating their defensive 50. The loose pill falls the former Crows way&#044; but Matt hits the post from 45. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Gibbs thumps it inside 50 with a classic up and under. Boekhorst grabs it at ground level and speedily moves it off to Ed Curnow. Ed receives and whacks it through from 35! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Once again the Swans are exceptional from the stoppage. Kennedy blasts his way out&#044; flicking it off to Hewett who launches to the hot spot. Parker flies&#044; marks and goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Gibbs launches high and long to the Casboult/Grundy contest and Levi takes a strong contested grab in the one on one. He lines up from 40 on the slight and goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 29:31)</span><br />
