#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Picken marks over Fox just outside the hotspot after Cloke intercepts in the centre. He kicks a cherry-on-top goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: The clock ticks under 1:00 with the Swans not looking like attacking. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:22)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: The Dogs rebound from a stoppage on the last line around the outer wing with an overlap&#044; Stringer passes to Murphy near the boundary 40m out&#044; who misses. 3:15 to go at the kick in. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Stringer gets a handball from Macrae at the next centre bounce and scoots away for a bomb from 55m... that is good too! Dogs hit back&#044; what a contest! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Mils is pinged for deliberate rushing with Picken five metres off him at the top of the square. Picken takes the free on the behind line&#044; and goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Picken starts a rebound from defensive hotspot and sprints forward to mark a Cloke ball in the pocket with gut-busting stamina&#044; he goes to the square where Bontempelli goals. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: After Aliir beats Tom Boyd on the least line&#044; Picken catches Kennedy HTB at the hotspot trying to lope out of defence. Picken sprays it horribly&#044; unlike last year's GF. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Another centre clearance for Sydney&#044; Jack passes to the lead of Reid 40m out on the flank. Reid boots his sixth goal&#044; Swans in front! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Jack marks the next centre clearance at CHF&#044; turns and goes to Franklin 55m out on a slight angle&#044; plays on again and repeats the dose! Buddy is the best player in the AFL. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:04)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Cunningham passes to Franklin running down the wing&#044; Buddy has nothing on inside so runs his full measure and puts the full hoof into it from 60m... sails through! What a champ! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:18)</span><br />
