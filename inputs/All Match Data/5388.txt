#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cunningham receives the free kick after Savage had an unrealistic attempt at the mark.

Jack settles on the goal target&#044; but his running attempt at goal misses to the left hand side from 40. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Kennedy receives at pace and misses the running shot from 35 under pressure&#044; to the left hand side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Goodes takes a mark deep in the pocket&#044; but once again&#044; the Swans take little time and pay the consequences with a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:45)</span><br />
