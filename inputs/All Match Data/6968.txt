#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Darling marks 25m out and jams it through the goals. With 15 seconds left&#044; Eagles&#044; you may sing your song.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:13)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Billings sidesteps Duggan in the pocket and snaps a phenomenal goal on his left boot. The high-quality goal brings them within two goals&#044; but time is the enemy for St. Kilda. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Jack Steele is the recipient of 50m penalty which brings him within scoring range. He lines up and kicks the goal but it's too little&#044; too late for the Saints. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Sheed is involved again&#044; this time with a set-shot opportunity. From just inside 50&#044; he misses&#044; kicking the Eagles' eighth behind of the quarter. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:49)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: It's yet another behind for the Eagles&#044; this time attributed to the hasty left boot of Dom Sheed from 45. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:34)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Venables passes to Waterman who marks at full stride. His attempt from 40 on a slight angle misses.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:04)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Sinclair crumbs a contest in the hot spot and gives to Newnes who sprays the easy shot.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:35)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Matt Parker drags his 45m set shot to the left in what has been a quiet night for the livewire. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Ryan combines with Shuey and then Gaff gets involved&#044; shooting from 40m on the run. It's wide.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: It's Wilkie&#044; Phillips and then Billings as the last link in the chain. Jack will line up on the wrong side for a left-footer&#044; but his kick looks good! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:02)</span><br />
