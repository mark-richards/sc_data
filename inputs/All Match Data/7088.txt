#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: It's been a tale of two halves today - the first tightly contested&#044; and the second utterly dominated by the Dogs. The siren sounds and the Dogs edge into the top 8! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The Giants continue to make errors&#044; this time resulting in a crucial turnover. Lloyd pops a pass to Dale at the 40 who slides it straight through the middle.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Naughton tumbles in to mark the Johannisen entry in front of Haynes but his slight is marginally wide.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Two A-grade handballs from Hunter and Bontempelli set up Lipinski who nails the right-foot snap from 35. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:25)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A chain of retreating handballs ends with Trengove who rushes a shot from 40 that misses to the left.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:04)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Heavy pressure in the middle forces the Giants to cough up the footy to Lloyd who hits Schache on the lead. The 45m attempt sneaks home&#044; making it 10 goals in a row for the Dogs.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:54)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: An angry Heath Shaw gives away a 50m penalty for late contact after the mark&#044; bringing Lloyd within range. The drop punt from 40 is as clean as you'll see.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:08)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Johannisen dashes through the middle before Smith sends a low pass to Dale who marks close to goal. From 20m&#044; Dale nails it and makes the W almost a certainty.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:24)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Davis boots it OOTF with a rushes clearance. Hunter then sends it straight back where Naughton flies to clunk a strong contested mark. From 30m&#044; he misses.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:24)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Hill takes it forward of the wing and holds it patiently until he can spot Greene loose in the 50. Toby starts it to the right and that's where it stays <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:49)</span><br />
