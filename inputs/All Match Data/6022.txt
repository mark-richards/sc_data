#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Bernie Vince charges into the goal with less than a minute to play. The former Crow dribbles the shot from 30 and somehow manages to miss another. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 31:08)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Selwood finds Menzel out the back and Daniel takes the grab. Unopposed the star charges forward and sends it through for his fourth of the day! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Selwood marks and receives the 50 metre penalty after late contact by Tom McDonald. Joel lines it up from 45 on the slight angle and the captain sends it through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Story of the day has been the lack of efficiency in front of goals by the Dees. Another chance goes begging with the Kent effort. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:19)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hunt launches to the hot spot and Kent flies once more. Dean pulls down an outstanding mark in the 4 strong pack and the small forward misses to the right hand side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:57)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Parfitt catches Harmes holding the ball and thus provides the exclamation point to an exceptional game from the youngster. Brandon shoots from 35 on the flank and goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:57)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Jetta misses the target and Duncan is there to pounce. He gathers and finds McCarthy unmarked directly in front inside 45. Lincoln shoots but misses the gilt edged opportunity. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Lonergan gives it up directly to Hannan after missing the ball to hand. Horrendous error and the third gamer makes them pay from point blank range! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:39)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Dangerfield receives inside congestion and Patrick needs little time to decide what he needs to do. From 45&#044; he thumps it on the left boot and through it goes! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Mezel flies at the top of the square as the Cats send it deep into the F50 once more. McCarthy waits front and centre&#044; reading it off hands and sending it through from close range! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:26)</span><br />
