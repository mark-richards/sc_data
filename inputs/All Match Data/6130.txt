#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Swans bound out of defence with Heeney thumping the pill out the back to Rohan ahead of McKenzie. Gary marks and misses to the left hand side from 55. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Gold Coast win the resultant centre stoppage with Witts tapping down to Swallow. David darts to the leading Wright who marks a step outside fifty. He slots the set shot! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:06)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Swans surge it forward once more and although May gains possession&#044; he turns it over inside fifty to Melican. The youngster marks and goals from 40 on the slight! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Towers launches long to the hotspot. Newman gets to the drop zone and attempts to gain some space to attempt the shot. He flicks back to McVeigh who misses from 40. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:51)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Towers dabs the pass onto the chest of the leading Newman and Nic takes the uncontested mark. He shoots for his sixth goal of the season and misses to the near side from 35. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:37)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Suns goal! The bronx cheers ring out in accord. Ainsworth&#044; Lemmens and Ah Chee link by hand inside fifty before Sean runs his measure and snaps it through from 30! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Suns enjoy a rare forward fifty entry. Neither Wright nor Rosa is able to gather the ball off the deck. Eventually the former Eagle soccers from the pocket for a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Swans continue their relentless effort&#044; this time with Rohan finding Jones unmarked inside thirty. Zac makes no mistake from directly in front! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Rohan wins the possession with a strong tackle that forces the free kick. Gary darts it onto the chest of the leading Franklin. Lance shoots from 35 on the flank and misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:08)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Towers demonstrates fantastic skills below the knees to take the one grab off the deck ahead of Saad. He launches long and Rohan gathers&#044; flicks to Papley and Tom goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 1:02)</span><br />
