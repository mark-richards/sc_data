#####<em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Sydney get the ball forward from a long kickout but have no one to kick to inside 50. Kennedy has to bomb long from 55 but misses to the right. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Duncan marks a Caddy shanked kick for goal in the pocket&#044; improves the angle with a barely 15m kick to Motlop who goes back and goals. Too easy for Geelong. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Blicavs with composure chips to Stokes 40m out on a 45 degree angle. He puts it through and the Cats are home! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Motlop speeds down the wing&#044; kicks for goal but it's offline and Caddy just hangs onto the mark. He's put on the angle for the shot but arcs around and extends the lead to 20. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:41)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Hannebery marks strongly on 50&#044; plays on and kicks the running goal from 45. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Lloyd gets away from Stokes far too easily on the wing. He marks&#044; takes a bounce&#044; has the shot from 45 but it bounces through for a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:10)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Lang attempts a very ambitious banana on the run from the pocket. It misses and Motlop's unhappy it didn't go to him at the top of the square. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:53)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Selwood raises the arm and gets a very soft free against Kennedy. Despite being within range&#044; he hits up Hawkins 35m out on a 45 degree angle. Hawkins converts&#044; Geelong up by 20. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:06)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Selwood marks outside 50&#044; wheels around and hits Hawkins on the chest 30m out almost directly in front. He goals. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 0:54)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Guthrie marks at high half forward on the lead&#044; Rampe fails to get back to the mark and gives away 50. Guthrie's set shot from 30m out on a slight angle misses to the left. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 22:04)</span><br />
