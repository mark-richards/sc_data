#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The siren sounds to signal a 100 point victory for the Adelaide Crows! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:19)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Sutcliffe has the opportunity to bring it back down the triple figure once more. Pressured on the kick from 30&#044; his dribble bounces the wrong side of the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Blakely gathers from the forward 50 stoppage and throws pill to boot in pursuit of decreasing the margin back to two figures. Alas&#044; a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: That goal brings up the triple figure margin. In Lyon's 250 matches as senior coach&#044; he has never been beaten by three digits. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cameron grabs it out the back and charges away from the counterparts. Charlie flicks over the top to Jenkins and Josh hammers it home from point blank range! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:09)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cameron finds it deep in the forward pocket and has only one thing in mind. He spins on a dime and sends through the picture perfect snap for the goal of the night! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:49)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: B.Hill dribbles it forward of the coalface. Mundy gathers at ground level and flicks off to the youngster in Tucker. Darcy hammers it from the arc of 50 for his second of the term! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:14)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Otten takes another contested grab&#044; taking the ball at its highest point over Sutcliffe and S.Hill. Andy shoots from 25 and kicks his fourth! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hughes sends it long to the hot spot. McCarthy is the only one to keep his feet. However he misses the shot from deep in the forward pocket&#044; hitting the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:36)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Milera is caught high in the attempted tackle by Pearce and the youngster will line up for his third of the night. Shooting from 40 on the slight&#044; Wayne sends it through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:18)</span><br />
