#####<em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: C Ellis pops one up into the hot spot and Cotchin rises to take a clunking mark. He goes back from point blank and goals. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:04)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Martin evades a diving Baguley and puts it on the chest of Griffiths who stood alone 40 out on the flank. His shot is a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:54)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Parish goes back with the flight to mark 40 out on the flank. He goes back and puts it just across the face. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:29)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: A Zaharakis turn over at half back gives Richmond a look and the ball is sent deep inside 50.

His shot at goal is off line. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:54)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Bird roves the tap from a stoppage deep inside 50. He flicks it up to Parish who can steer one through from 10 out on a significant angle. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:24)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Morris powers through the middle and sends a floater inside 50. It bounces to the favour of Rioli who taps it forward to Riewoldt. He goals with pressure from Ambrose. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 29:27)</span><br />
