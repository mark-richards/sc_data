#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Lions hold on for a fantastic win in a classic Q Clash! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Zorko won the free kick for high contact&#044; and found Bastinac with a short dab pass&#044; allowing the former Roo to line up just inside the arc on the flank. Ryan goes back and goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hanley manages a massive goal to give the Lions the lead once more. Out of the forward stoppage&#044; Walker taps it down to Hanley&#044; who takes one step and whacks it home from 45! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cutler has his second of the game as the Lions hit the lead once more. Tom began his run from half back&#044; Lester forced the turn over with a tackle on May and Tom was the recipient! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:19)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Taylor weights a perfect delivery&#044; allowing Ryan Lester to mark it ahead of Gardiner. From the acute angle&#044; 35 out&#044; Ryan misses to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Sexton forces the turn over with a terrific tackle on the half forward flank.He kicks it to the hot spot from the free&#044; and Hall is the one reading it off hands and snapping truly! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:29)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Lynch to Malceski&#044; who takes a couple of bounces down the wing as he accesses the options before finding Sexton with a quality delivery. Alex finishes from 25 on the slight! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: It starts off half back with Christensen moving it forward at pace&#044; and the play ends with Walker taking the simple lead up mark. From the set shot&#044; he misses to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Lions go coast to coast&#044; ending with Walker finding Christensen out the back. The former Cat runs through to point blank range and hammers home the fantastic play! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Saad to Hall who runs through the middle&#044; but Merrett manages to just slow him down for that split second&#044; clipping his heel with a dramatic drive. Aaron misses from 50. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:44)</span><br />
