#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Dale influence the contest once more&#044; taking the grab from the Roughead clearance win. The siren sounds as Bailey slams it through the middle! The DOGS are home! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Dale manages to find Bontempelli pounding at pace through the corridor&#044; with Marcus taking the grab. From 45 on the slight&#044; Marcus goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Crows go COAST TO COAST! Betts marks out the back and flicks it further to Jenkins. Josh receives and hammers home his eighth! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Dale receives the free kick for high contact in the attempted tackle against the Crows veteran&#044; Scott Thompson. From 45&#044; boundary side&#044; Bailey grabs a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Biggs darts it into the leading Bontempelli&#044; and Marcus takes the grab out ahead of the former Hawk in Cheney. From 45 on the flank&#044; he pulls it poorly to the far side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cameron reads it off the pack&#044; and Charlie wastes little time in snapping truly from the pocket. Adcock was harshly adjudged to deliberately have taken it out of bounds just prior. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Walker takes a high flying mark just 20 metres out from goal over the top of Liberatore. McGovern provided the central pass&#044; and Taylor makes it count with a major! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:46)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Jacobs gives away the free kick and then 50 metre penalty for not giving the ball back quickly enough. It allows Boyd to find Dickson&#044; and Tory goals from 45 on the flank! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:46)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cameron finds it at ground level and hands it off to Betts. Eddie has a rare sight at goal&#044; but misses from 40 to the left hand side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: McGovern wins it at ground level after Wood could only manage to bring it to ground. Mitch belts it down the throat of Jenkins&#044; who marks 30 out for goal. He has his seventh! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:26)</span><br />
