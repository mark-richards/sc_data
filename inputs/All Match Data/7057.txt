#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Great running from big Goldstein is unrewarded&#044; as his galloping 35m shot is reviewed and determined touched off fingertips.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: LDU works it forward solo from the centre bounce to the hot spot. Scholfield drops the mark which allows Brown to pounce and snap a late goal&#044; taking the margin back to 50.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The Eagles go end to end&#044; exposing North's lack of pressure yet again. Rioli pokes a pass to Hickey who goes back and squeezes it home from 35. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Rioli wastes an opportunity for an almost certain goal&#044; not releasing the handball&#044; instead electing for the grubber dribbler kick from 40 which narrowly misses.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:14)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Another opportunity presents for Anderson just a minute later&#044; this time with a set play from 40. Again though&#044; he can't convert.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:14)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Anderson emerges through traffic and gets a wayward shot away from 35. It was also touched by a diving McGovern&#044; so results in a minor score either way.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Darling has a chance to extend the lead with a 50m set shot but doesn't strike it well enough&#044; through for a minor score.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:29)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: This kick from Dumont is an improved one&#044; hitting Ben Brown inside 50 in the pocket. He's had a quiet day thus far&#044; but Ben nails the 40m set shot&#044; despite the tricky angle.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A poor Dumont kick allows the Eagles to find Sheed who bounces down the HFF and take his pick of free teammates. Waterman marks at 40 and kicks the goal from straight in front.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Zurhaarâ€™s long-range set shot has the distance but not the accuracy. However&#044; a minute later he gets another opportunity from much closer range which he has no problem converting.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:44)</span><br />
