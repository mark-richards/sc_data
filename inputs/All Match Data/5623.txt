#####<em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Siren blows as Hall gets a set shot on goal from the pocket. Suns win and he sprays it to just barely get a point. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Sam Day hits the post after a relatively easy set shot but it's all one way as Lynch gets a mark 25 out and... Hits the post as well!  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Sexton gets free in the goalsquare after Harbrow blitzes the rest of the field from half back to allow Lynch to spear a kick in his direction. Easy easy goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Casboult runs on to a bouncing ball at half forward and gives to the marginally better kick in Daisy Thomas for a running shot from 40&#044; but Daisy misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:57)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Lynch gets his fourth goal to put the Suns even further ahead after Sexton gifts it to him via a short pass inside 50 that isn't even called a mark. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:34)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Rischitelli gets the quick hands out of the centre bounce and runs before delivering to Lynch in the pocket. Lynch's shot is true and Suns are 40 in front. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Hall marks at half forward and swivels to dart a ball to a leading Martin 35 out from goal. His low angle shot sails through for a goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Matera burns his team mates running in from 40n out right in front as he misses the goal without much pressure at all. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:28)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Malceski kicks high to the advantage of Lynch who is just too big for Docherty to manage. From the pocket he goes for the banana but he misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Martin grabs himself an easy goal as Sam Rowe makes a horrible decision to tap the ball to no one but Suns players after a contest deep inside 50. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 24:19)</span><br />
