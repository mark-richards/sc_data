#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Final siren! Vardy took two decisive marks in the last couple of minutes and the Eagles hold on for a seven point victory! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Three minutes and ten seconds to play. The Eagles have sent ten men back into defence. Seven point ball game... <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:49)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: VARDY! Another stoppage goal for the Eagles! Nathan pushes off Campbell&#044; grabs the bouncing pill and slams it through from the top of the square! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Barrass takes the strong mark deep in defence. Tom then dabs the pass and Stringer cuts it off. Jake gathers and goals from point blank range! One point ball game! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:04)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Wallis gathers the ground ball as the Dogs hack their inside 50 effort to the small. Mitch rounds the arc and scores a minor from the flank. Six and a half minutes left to play. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Make that an 8 point margin... <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Dale forces the ball to ground level against Petrie and predictably gathers off the deck. Bailey flicks off to Roughead and Jordan hammers it through to make it a 9 point margin! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Sheed turns it over through the corridor and finds Bontempelli whilst doing so. Marcus sends it goalward and scores just the minor score&#044; unleashing from 55 on the flank. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:34)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Wallis throws Mackenzie out of the marking contest and the dubious decision is made to pay the mark. Mitch lines up the set shot and sends it through from 40 on the slight! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Shuey drives the ball to the leading Darling and Jack takes yet another mark ahead of Cordy. Duggan forced the turnover with the repeat effort through the middle. Jack misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:05)</span><br />
