#####<em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: The ball gets locked into the Saint's pocket and both teams scrap to gain clean possession. Billings eventually finds Battle by hand and he pops it through. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Kelly marks 40 out but is called to play on as it didn't travel the required distance. He receives a free for high contact anyway. He finds Greene 30 out who goals. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Hopper bursts past a loping Hickey and goes inside 50. Billings drops a sitter and Greene finds the loose ball. His snap is a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Whitfield goes central where Battle spoils Davis well. Gresham spots up a Membrey lead and he marks in front of Taylor. He hits the post from 30. Another chance goes begging! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:57)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Sinclair dashes down the middle and spots up a Steven lead into the pocket&#044; giving Kennedy no chance. From 30 out he slots it. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:46)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Langdon catches Lonie cold but falls into his back at the final moment. Lonie goes back from 50 and misses the set shot. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Shaw does well to disrupt a Lonie pass on the wing. The long ball goes to Lobb who takes a bite at it and then is caught high by Gilbert. He goals from 20 out. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Daniels centres the ball but misses the target. Geary tries to gather but only manages to knock it into the path of Shiel. He takes a shot from 30 but misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: A great spoil from Shaw denies Gresham and lands in the lap of Buntine. The Giants go down the guts and Lobb launches a bomb from 60. It just misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Taranto out-marks Gilbert on the wing and plays on quickly. He goes to the flank where Langdon marks in front of Coffield. He goes back it slots it from just on his range!  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 29:26)</span><br />
