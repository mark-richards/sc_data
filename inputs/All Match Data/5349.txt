#####<em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: The full time siren goes with the ball in Lindsay Thomas' hands 25 out from goal directly in front. He kicks it through and the team song plays. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Everitt gets himself a second goal from a set shot 25 out from goal directly in front&#044; but with a minute to go the celebrations are minimal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Swallow gets a clearance immediately to Thomas 20 out who chips to Higgins 30 out in a better position. With little angle&#044; he comes close to the post but it's a goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Waite gets himself a nice goal and two for the night as he swings around a snapping shot at goal after roving a contest and snapping a goal from 40 out. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Ben Brown sneakily gets in the way of Jamison&#044; allowing Cunnington to get ahead of him and mark 45 out right in front. He has a good shot at it and it goes through for a goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 0:39)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Lindsay Thomas sees Ziebell's goal from earlier and decides to try it himself&#044; marking on the opposite side and mirroring the goal to perfection&#044; slotting it through. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 0:39)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Ziebell somehow grabs himself the Roos' first goal of the last quarter as he marks on the boundary 35 out from goal on the wrong side for a right footer and drop punts it through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 0:39)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Three in a row to the Roos as a thump forward by Goldstein gets picked up by Ziebell and he runs to the edge of the 50 before bombing home a long goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 27:54)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: The speed of the Kangaroos' play has caught Carlton off guard in the last 5 minutes&#044; as Swallow's spread lets him mark alone 25 out from goal. With no angle&#044; he puts it through. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 26:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Goldstein gets himself involved in a score again as he marks just outside the 50 arc on the lead and delivers to Ben Brown on the boundary. From 25 out he barely misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 24:46)</span><br />
