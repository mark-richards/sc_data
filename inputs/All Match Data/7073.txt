#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Wagner crumbs at the hot spot and scrambles a kick that bobbles through for a minor score. The Dees have lifted their intensity but left their surge far too late.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Petracca is held without the ball by Crisp&#044; allowing the Dees to go inside 50 where Gawn marks at 40m and kicks the goal.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:23)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Oscar McDonald gets a late consolation prize after receiving a grubber pass from Hunt and snapping truly on his left from 30. Four goals the margin with six minutes left... <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Lewis sends it inside 50 where Fritsch marks behind Phillips with a dominant leap. His shot from 35&#044; however&#044; is offline.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:21)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A powerful and accurate left-foot entry kick from Fritsch finds Hunt in space ahead of Howe. He goes back and sneaks it in from 40. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Fritsch spins on a dime and snaps on his left from 25 but it bends too much&#044; missing to the right.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Treloar's centering kick is a poor one&#044; coughing it up to Petracca who fends off Madgen before launching it through the big sticks from 50 on the run.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: With eyes only for the footy&#044; Mihocek flies back to bravely clunk the Adams entry kick.  From 45&#044; directly in front&#044; Brody nails it.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Crisp swoops at half-back&#044; gets the one-two with Pendlebury on the wing&#044; then takes a bounce&#044; dashes away from Jones&#044; and launches it from 55&#044; bouncing it through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 24:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Adams sends it inside 50 where Mihocek is able to clunk the mark after Level slips over. From 25 without much of an angle&#044; Brody boots number 3.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 20:29)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Sidebottom lets one fly on the run from 35 on a tight angle. Itâ€™s a half pass&#044; half shot which doesnâ€™t eventuate effectively to either intended result&#044; missing to the left.
