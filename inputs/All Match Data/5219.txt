#####<em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Swan takes an easy mark at half forward and turns to go to Karnezis alone 35 out right in front for the easy strolling in goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Paddy McCartin drops an easy mark at half forward&#044; but his gather is top notch and he drills it to Billings 30 out near the boundary. His set shot misses to the far left side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Cloke manages to get his fifth goal after Dwyer takes a very easy mark unopposed deep in the forward 50 and hands it over to him for the lazy goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:44)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Saints can't seem to find a way out of their defense as they turn it over again which leads to more slippery play and a spinning Cloke snap in the pocket gets a goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Collingwood go in and out of their 50 too many times to count before a Dwyer snap gets a behind. They get it back&#044; but Cloke's pocket free only yields a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: McCartin gets the ball at centre half back and kicks wide to Newnes who marks on the wing to kick and gather the hands back to kick again to Bruce 35 out right in front for a goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:49)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Pies go out of the middle again and kick it forward where Dwyer marks 30 out but he struggles with the 45 angle and barely misses to the left. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:25)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Saints get themselves a little consolation prize after runs from Steven and Schneider get it inside 50 and Armitage sneaks away with a goal after hanging around the contests. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:54)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Oxley gets himself a free for a high tackle and the advantage is taken quickly so they can move the ball to Cloke on the lead. He marks 45 out on a sharp angle and kicks it through <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:44)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>MattyZ</em>: Pendlebury takes a high tackle just inside 50 and does everyone's fantasy teams a huge favour by handing it off to Oxley for a long running goal from 55. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:38)</span><br />
