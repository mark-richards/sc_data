#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Murphy pulls his entry kick to Kreuzer but the big man leaves it for a steaming Harry McKay. He marks uncontested but misses from 45. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Murphy spears a kick toward Cripps on the 50 which comes off hands into the gloves of  McKay. He collects cleanly and snaps a stellar goal from 45m on the run! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Simpson intercepts at the HBF and streams forward&#044; taking a couple of bounces through the corridor before popping it to Deluca. From 48&#044; directly in front&#044; he nails it! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: All within the attacking 50&#044; Lonie pokes a chipped pass to Bruce who does the same to Membrey&#044; playing on and snapping it truly from 15m. Saints take the lead!  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:10)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Billings goes long to the Carlisle and Casboult contest but the Blue is out of position&#044; giving away a free for front-on contact. Jake makes no mistake with the simple set shot.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Silvagni picks up the footy on the bounce&#044; releasing backward to O'Brien who sets up  Dow for the goal off a couple of steps from 35. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Bruce runs himself into trouble in the worst possible spot. McGovern pounces&#044; soccering the goal from just outside the square&#044; giving the Blues the lead.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Lang spins on a dime before spotting up McKay on the lead in the pocket to start the final term. His shot is never a chance&#044; scraping in for a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 1:24)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Cripps and McKay combine to work it forward to Silvagni. He marks milliseconds after the siren. One umpire calls the mark&#044; the other says the siren sounded first. 3QT&#044; no shot.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(3 Qtr Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Cripps collects on the flank and uses his speed to find some space&#044; giving it over to Kreuzer who can't convert from 40 on the run.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 25:45)</span><br />
