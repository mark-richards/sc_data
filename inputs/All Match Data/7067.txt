#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Butler streams inside 50&#044; linking up with Bolton who marks 20m out. Without much of an angle&#044; he has no issue slotting it through.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Oskar Baker dabs a left-foot snap into the runway of Fritsch who slides in to hold the mark but can't convert from 30. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Wagner roves a spoil in Melbourne's goalsquare but the running&#044; snapping shot is always wayward.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Grimes catches Dunkley high with a glancing blow which gifts Kyle a look at the sticks. He hits it sweetly from 45&#044; bringing the margin back to 28 points. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Mcdonald's kickout is poor&#044; falling straight into the arms of Martin just outside the 50. He wheels around and boots it home impressively.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:46)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The Tigers surge through the corridor before Rioli launches one from 50. Riewoldt drops the mark on the goal line&#044; one which he didn't necessarily have to attempt.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Rioli catches Hibberd HTB 30m out&#044; directly in front&#044; but can't convert the set shot.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Kennedy-Harris' defensive clearance is only as far as Caddy who pops a pass over the top to the leading Riewoldt. Jack's 40m attempt hangs out to the left&#044; not helped by the angle. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The rain is continuing to come down early in the fourth&#044; which is making clean football difficult for both sides.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Fritsch is about to line up from downtown when an off-the-ball whack to the midriff from Astbury on Petty gifts Bailey a 50m penalty. It becomes the easiest of goals. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:17)</span><br />
