#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The Swans get the centre clearance but give away the free kick once inside their attacking 50. That'll do it... Well done Blues! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: McCartin passes wide to Lloyd who kicks the goal from 50 with a minute to go. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Dawson's defensive kick is sloppy&#044; allowing the Blues to capitalise. Lang and Dow combine before McKay runs into the open goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Zak Jones dashes through the centre square before spotting Reid advantaged in his one-on-one. Sam goes back and nails the set shot.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Silvagni intercepts a very poor Lloyd switch kick&#044; but can't convert his 45m running shot. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:24)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Papley gets a hurried shot away from close to the boundary which is never online.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Following a coast-to-coast play&#044; Papley lines up to shoot but passes at the last second to Heeney. Isaac marks at 25 and slots the goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Gibbons' kick drops short into the lap of Silvagni who'll line up from outside 50. His attempt doesn't make the distance&#044; off hands for a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A clean Florent spots up Heeney in the pocket who quickly links with Papley at a much better angle. Tom plays on but wastes his opportunity. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Silvagni makes it two in a row for the Blues to kickstart the fourth with an accurate right-foot snap from the pocket after finding himself free out the back of the congestion. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:18)</span><br />
