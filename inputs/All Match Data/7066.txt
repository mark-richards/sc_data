#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Switkowski has a chance of his own within the last minute of the match but the accuracy is missing&#044; through for a behind. The siren sounds - Dockers claim a huge scalp!  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Switkowski pokes a pass to Mundy who nabs it on the second bite&#044; centimetres inside the boundary line. David goes back and nails the drop punt to put the cherry on top. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Guthrie is fed by Duncan and launches one from 55 that sails marginally over the players on the line&#044; bringing the margin back to 27 with 5 minutes left.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:29)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Matera has a chance to inflict further damage&#044; however&#044; his 40m shot is under pressure and bounces offline.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:06)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A timely spoil from Henry spills out into the lap of Duman who snaps off a step to slot his first goal in footy and put the game beyond doubt. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:06)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Bews crumbs off the back off the Kolodjashnij entry kick but can't hook it back enough&#044; missing narrowly to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Mundy hooks a centering pass on his left boot to Langdon who marks in plenty of space at the 35. From directly in front&#044; Ed makes it seriously tough for the Cats. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Langdon tumbles one toward goal from 45 that doesnâ€™t quite get the bounce he would have liked&#044; through for a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Langdon sends a bomb into a dangerous area that comes to ground off hands. Matera is best placed to swoop and dance around before snapping the goal and putting his boys up by 20. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Despite an abnormally quiet day&#044; Mundy steps up when it counts and seizes his moment&#044; crumbing a Darcy palm-down at the hot spot and snapping truly on his left. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:28)</span><br />
