#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: With just 30 seconds left to play the Dees add some icing to a very tasty cake. Kent gathers at ground level via the aerial contest and snaps truly from 25! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Otten takes another contested grab as the swing forward appears to have reaped some benefits. Andy shoots from 20 on the slight angle and manages to miss the soda. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Lynch sends it to Otten who ghosts out the back and Wagner is unable to contest. Andy shoots from 45 on the slight and thuds his set shot into the post as we play out time. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Oliver is the next Dee to throw it on the boot out of congestion to aplomb. Clayton finds Petracca playing in front&#044; with Christian marking ahead of Hartigan. He goals from 30! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Smith takes the corridor mark inside 40 after Douglas centred the ball out of congestion. Brodie shoots from directly in front and the former All Australian slams it through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Walker roosts his shot from the best part of 60 on the turn. His thumping effort misses to the right hand side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Kent throws it on the boot out of the thick of congestion and finds the unmarked Hannan out the back. It was as if he was wearing an invisibility cloak... Mitch goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Atkins punts onto the chest of Jenkins&#044; with Josh marking strongly on the lead ahead of O. McDonald. Josh shoots from 35 on the slight and snaps it through with ease! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Garlett sends it over the top and Kent marks just a step outside of the goal square. To place the nail in the coffin&#044; Dean finishes with ease from close range! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The umpire decides Otten's soccer was deliberate&#044; with Garlett receiving the free from deep in the pocket. Jeff makes no mistake via the snap for his second! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:47)</span><br />
