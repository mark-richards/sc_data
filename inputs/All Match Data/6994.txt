#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Another Sydney transition from defence to offence primarily by hand eventually ends with a Franklin mark within range. From 40&#044; he slides it to the near side.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Sydney work it forward hastily through the corridor. Parker is the last link in the chain&#044; sending a long bomb toward goal from 60 which isn't close enough. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:09)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Stewart keeps the ball in play on the flank&#044; takes a bounce&#044; runs inboard&#044; and almost snaps a remarkable goal. However&#044; it's offline. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Clark receives in space just outside the 50m arc. He winds up&#044; but last-second pressure forces his shot wide. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Fox's stoppage kick goes straight up and straight down&#044; fortunately falling into the path of Menzel. Dan kicks the easiest of goals against his old side.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:46)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Jordan Clark sends it inside 50. Aliir is pinged for a hold on Ratugolea who goes back and slots the goal from 30m. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: O'Connor and Stewart collide mid-air to spoil each other. It falls to Blakey who strolls into the open goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Dahlhaus is able to find a couple of metres of space out the back of congestion but can't bend his snap back enough. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:46)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The Swans cleanly win the first centre clearance of the last term through Sinclair and Heeney. Papley is able to get a quick away shot from 50m which narrowly misses.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 1:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Sinclair palms it down to Heeney who centers from the boundary. Menzel and Kolodjashnij compete in the goal square to a nil-all draw. The end result is a behind to the Cats. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 29:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Dangerfield snags one from the goal line with the last kick of the game. The Cats win and go two games clear on top of the ladder. <br />
