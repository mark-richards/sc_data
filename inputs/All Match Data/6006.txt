#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Breust gets crunched and the pill falls the way of his counterpart. Tipungwuti receives it inside 50&#044; flicks it off to Stanton and deja vu&#044; Brent finishes another from 50! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:46)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Gleeson slips at the inopportune moment and Puopolo is the one to lay the tackle&#044; receiving the decision. He shoots from the sharp angle and goals via the set shot! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Smith finds Burgoyne inside 50 as the Hawks play out the final 7 minutes of the quarter. Burgoyne plays on but misses the opportunity from 40 on the slight angle. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:51)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Heppell takes the intercept mark wedged in between three Hawks and the Bombers man has a chance to ice the game. Ice he does&#044; Dyson has his third! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Burgoyne finds it on the deck as the champion Hawk and Power man goes forward. He handballs it to his new captain and Jarryd makes no mistake from 35! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Daniher marks through the middle as the Bombers run through the guts unmarked once more. Joe receives&#044; turns and sends it through on the run from 35! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Smith chips it inside and O'Meara ghosts in to take the mark 30 metres out directly in front. The game has never been more open as Jaeger trots in and misses badly. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:06)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Puopolo darts the pill onto the chest of Breust who marks unopposed. Luke lines up from 50 on the flank but misses the set shot to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Tipungwuti feeds it out to Hooker&#044; who managed to keep his feet just moments prior where Frawley could not. Cale sends it goalward but misses from 50. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:37)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Again the Bombers waltz through the MCG corridor unattended. Tipungwuti sends it down the throat of Hooker who takes the mark opposed to Frawley. He finishes from close range! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:41)</span><br />
