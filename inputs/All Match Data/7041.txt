#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Marshall launches it inside 50 where Membrey flies to take an impressive contested mark. Tim goes back&#044; shoots from 45&#044; and misses. Siren sounds. Well done&#044; Cats! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:14)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A hurried Taylor clearance from the wing lands in the lap of Parfitt at 45m. His shot drops short before Clark and Selwood link up&#044; finally resulting in a Hawkins goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Hunter Clark sends it inside 50 where a convenient slip from Blicavs allows Bruce to mark with ease. He shoots from 40m&#044; directly in front&#044; and kicks his third of the evening.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:06)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Ablett goes BANG and then BANG again with two high-quality goals in the space of two minutes&#044; taking the lead out to an almost-certain winning margin. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Hawkins feeds it out by hand to Bews who takes a ping from the pocket&#044; but with a tough angle for a leftie&#044; it's no good. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Stewart coughs it up under pressure&#044; deep in defence. The footy spills out to Acres who quickly throws it on the boot from the pocket and it sails over the goal umpire's head! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:34)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Ratugolea misses a set-shot then clunks a big grab 30 seconds later. This one from 25m out&#044; directly in front&#044; is much better&#044; and the Cats extend their lead. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: In search of the first final-quarter goal&#044; Newnes lines up from 45 on a tight angle but drags it left. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:44)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Long soccers it a couple of times but won't be winning any World Cups with that strike&#044; off to the left for a minor score from 15m.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 24:13)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Duncan makes it three in a row for the Cats to start the third term with a quality running goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 22:25)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Despite Coffield's front position&#044; Dangerfield is able to reach higher and clunk the mark coming in from Ratugolea. A bit of an angle is no problem as he slots the goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 17:45)</span><br />
