#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: McCluggage offloads by hand to Robinson who grubbers an attempt toward goal from 50&#044; eventually bouncing wide. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Hayward strikes his 45m kick with intent but it flies by the wrong side of the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Zorko gets on his bike around the stoppage and snaps beautifully from the pocket to put the result beyond doubt.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Mitch Robinson is penalised for holding the man against Lloyd&#044; then gives away a 50m penalty for a bit of unnecessary rough conduct. Lloyd goals from 25m. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Papley has too much time on his hands&#044; leaving him in two minds between shooting and passing. The end result is a missed attempt on goal from 35. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Neale picks up the loose footy&#044; snaps on his left&#044; and misses to the far side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Heeney blasts the footy forward where Papley marks in front of Witherden in a contest that will test the ribs. Tom wheels around and kicks a fantastic goal from the 50. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: It could be 2 goals in 2 minutes for Robinson&#044; but an 'umpire's call' goal review results in a touched behind.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:51)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: McCartin dumps Walker behind play to kickstart a Brisbane attack. Lachie Neale is involved and Mitch Robinson kicks a great goal from the flank! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:51)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The Swans turn it over and McCluggage makes them pay with a running goal from 45m. It's almost out of range for Sydney now. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:50)</span><br />
