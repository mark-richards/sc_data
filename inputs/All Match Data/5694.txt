#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Enright turns it over to Whitfield from the stoppage. Lachie takes the mark but the siren goes to the roar of the Cats faithful. From 55 on the flank&#044; Lachie sends it through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Davis turns it over with a knock on&#044; allowing Dangerfield to run onto it at pace. Patrick flicks it off to Menzel&#044; and Daniel HAMMERS it home for the 16 point lead! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Selwood manages to hold his feet when the pack can't&#044; before dabbing in the short pass to the leading Hawkins. From 55 on the sharp angle&#044; Tom kicks a HUGE goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Ward finds Hopper with a dab pass&#044; allowing Jacob to mark out ahead of Henderson. The youngster trots in and slams it through from 40 on the flank! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Selwood produces a signature burst through a pack and clearance win&#044; finding Kersten on the lead. Shane lines up from dead in front&#044; 50 out&#044; but he misses once more. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Bartel scrambles it inside 50 and Daniel Menzel is the one to take an incredible grab&#044; hitting the pill at top speed ahead of Wilson. From 45 on the flank&#044; Daniel slots the goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Kersten receives the free kick for high contact in the marking contest against Davis. From 50 on the flank&#044; he misses to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Shiel wins it at the coalface and manages to pick out an unmarked Whitfield&#044; waiting just outside 50. He trots in and Lachie puts a stamp on a fine individual performance! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Enright failed to handle the Caddy handball. Lobb mopped up at ground level and flicked it wide to the eagerly anticipating Ward. Callan receives and snaps truly from 35! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Dangerfield bursts through the middle with footy in hand&#044; a sight to behold. The clearance falls the way of Hawkins&#044; but Tom's snap misses to the left from 30. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:52)</span><br />
