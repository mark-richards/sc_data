#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: McCarthy bullets in the pass to Cameron who marks just before the final siren sounds. From 40&#044; directly in front&#044; Jeremy has seven as the Giants win by 81 points! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 31:39)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Smith spots the unattended Whitfield and chips the delivery into his teammate&#044; who takes the simple mark from 40 out. Lachie goes back and slots the goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:08)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Greene finds Tomlinson out the back of his contest with Rowe&#044; but given the lack of pace in the game that was simply poor marking. Adam goals from 25! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:23)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cameron nabs his sixth of the day! Pressed up on the boundary&#044; 30 out&#044; Jeremy slots the snap shot after taking the mark out on the lead! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:53)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Brad Walsh has a flying shot at goal from inside 50 and manages the quick reply in his third game for the club! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Palmer drives the ball to the hot spot and Cameron takes the strong grab in the three-strong pack. From 25&#044; directly in front&#044; Jeremy kicks his fifth of the half and match! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Smith finds the ground ball and drills the pass to Cameron who marks out on the lead ahead of Jamison. From the set shot&#044; Cameron slots his fourth from 50&#044; dead in front! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:39)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Kelly grabs it out of the forward stoppage&#044; incredibly with little to no enforced pressure. In turn&#044; Josh settles and snaps truly from 35! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:06)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Kennedy goes for the spoil instead of the mark and it proves costly. The ball pops out the front and Tutt receives out the back to slot the simplistic major from 20! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Kelly handballs over the top to the hard running Greene. Toby continues on with limited pressure&#044; slotting the goal from 30 on the slight angle! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 30:48)</span><br />
