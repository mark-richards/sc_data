#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Shiel flicks it out to the hard running Scully&#044; who bolts onward and produces a terrific inside&#044; out banana from the boundary. Tremendous goal by the former Dee! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Sheridan produces a terrible turnover&#044; shanking it straight over the boundary line by a good 10 metres. Shiel is the recipient&#044; but he misses the 25 metre shot to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Walters receives in space from the Griffen flick. Michael sets sail for home from 40 on the flank&#044; but thuds his effort into the woodwork. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Whitfield sends it deep inside forward 50 and Lobb is the first to get to the ground level pill. Rory spins on a dime and manages to swing it in from an extremely acute angle! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:44)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Johnson launches to the one on one between Patton and Mundy&#044; with Jonathon predictably winning that contest. Patton finishes with his sixth from 25! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:44)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Lobb receives inside congestion and immediately throws it on the right peg. Rory's shot misses from 30 to the left hand side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Greene takes the next inside 50 mark&#044; as the Giants continue to be rampant from the centre stoppages. Toby lines up from 40 on the slight and nails his second! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:41)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Griffen produces a little dribbler to find Smith in space. Devon eventually moves it into the forward 50 and Johnson is the recipient. He spins and goals from 45 with the snap! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:44)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Ward dabs it into the path of Coniglio&#044; with Stephen marking on the lead ahead of Sutcliffe. He kicks from a step outside 50 and its touched on the line. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:09)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Griffen of the Jonathon variety goes through the legs of Patton and the free kick is paid the Giants way. Jonathon kicks from the pocket and snaps it through for his fifth! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:33)</span><br />
