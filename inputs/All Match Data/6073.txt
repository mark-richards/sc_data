#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Hawkins baulks two Dogs at half forward and centres to Dangerfield 45m out in front.

Redpath hits the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:28)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Dangerfield steams away from the next centre bounce and goes long to Menzel 20m out on a slight angle.
