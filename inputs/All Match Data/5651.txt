#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: In turn&#044; the Cats speed it from end to end and its finalised with Duncan finding Hawkins. Tom flicks it off to Kersten&#044; who sends through another! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:53)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cameron receives a 50 metre penalty&#044; and Clay will line up from 25 on the slight. He misses to compound the misery of the night! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:53)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Suns have a rare foray forward and it ends with Hall&#044; speeding through the corridor and heading for goal from 55. His shot bounces through for a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:53)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Caddy is found in acres of space after the Suns turned it over from the kick-in once more&#044; the pass coming from the boot of Bews. From 45 on the flank&#044; he misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Dangerfield finds it out the back as the Cats again move it forward with ease. Patrick pushes off his opponent&#044; grabs the ball and snaps with ease from close range! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Caddy has another to his name as the Cats speed it end to end. Selwood takes the uncontested mark from the long bomb and flicks it off to Josh&#044; who goals from point blank! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Davis slaps it away from the chasing Taylor&#044; into the hands of Malceski. Nick gathers and shoots from the sharp angle&#044; 40 out. He misses to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:44)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Kersten chips it forward and Caddy takes the uncontested mark&#044; the former Sun himself. Josh lines up from 50 on the flank&#044; and he sends it through to rapturous applause! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:44)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Mitch Duncan gives away the 50 metre penalty for encroaching on the mark&#044; which allows Lemmens to goal from 25. Slight consolation for the poor Suns! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Cats waltz it out of the centre of the ground once more&#044; and Hawkins is the recipient of the brilliant service his midfielders are delivering. From 40 on the slight&#044; he goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:46)</span><br />
