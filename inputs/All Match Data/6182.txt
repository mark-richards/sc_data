#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Wines&#044; Boak and Polec combine with Jared finalising the play with a terrific grab. The former Lion lines up the set shot from 40 out&#044; directly in front&#044; and he converts truly! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Exactly 3 minutes left to play&#044; can the Bulldogs mount a comeback? <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:44)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Polec and Ebert move it by hand between each other as Jared moves the ball from half back to inside 50. He dabs the pass and Gray marks.Robbie converts truly from 35 on the slight! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: 4:10 left to play with the ball on the outer wing as the umpire balls it up&#044; slightly to the Dogs attacking end. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Boak demonstrated a tremendous sidestep&#044; altering his path with sheer power. Morris was unable to force the issue&#044; Travis kicking to Wingard. Chad marks and goals from point blank! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: 6:18 left to play with the ball deep in the Port Adelaide defensive 50. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Houston takes McLean high in the attempted tackle and Toby will line up from 50 on the flank. He shoots and his effort is knocked through&#044; tying the score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Wingard places the ball into the path of Dixon and Charlie takes another lead up mark&#044; this time directly in front. He goes back and regains an advantage for the Power from 30! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:28)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Young forces the ball forward with a fist&#044; but Neade plays the role of crumber with sparkling efficiency. He gathers off the deck and whacks it forward&#044; missing from 50. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Dixon takes the lead up mark with Hunter trailing&#044; Charlie taking advantage of some quality Power ball use. The former Sun lines up from 40 on the slight and splits the middle! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:05)</span><br />
