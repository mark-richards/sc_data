#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Parker chips it to Franklin&#044; even with Lance on the much sharper angle as the siren sounds.

He goes back and booms it through&#044; post high!  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:51)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Swans over possessed with the best of them pushing from end to end&#044; but it finishes with Smith picking out the leading Sinclair. From 40 on the slight&#044; he misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:54)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: McGlynn reads it off the Franklin fly and moves it further down the park to his eagerly waiting captain in Jack.

Ben marks and goals from 30 out! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:35)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Redman off to Baguley who heads goalward&#044; kicking for goal from 45 on the acute angle.
