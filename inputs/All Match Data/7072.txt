#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Tomlinson is pinged for deliberate OOB 20m out&#044; Puopolo misses the free kick. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Mumford snaps truly from a stoppage 20m out but it was touched off the boot&#044; still no goals for GWS after half time. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Breust spins out of a tackle but misses off the left boot from near the hotspot. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Lewis marks a Hanrahan ball over Haynes at the top of the square for another one. These are junk time specials. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Henderson stands up in a tackle at the top of the square and gives to Lewis who goals. Hawks are running away with it! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:35)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Smith intercepts Greene behind the centre and breaks lines with a trademark run&#044; he kicks to grass in the pocket for Breust to run onto&#044; he shrugs a Shaw tackle and goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:13)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Wingard baulks Caldwell at half forward and kicks to the square&#044; Davis spoils Nash but Puopolo hits the crumb at pace and squeezes home the official sealer from the pocket. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 27:23)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Puopolo marks a high Smith ball near the boundary in front of Shaw 30m out&#044; his set shot is short and rebounded. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 24:08)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Puopolo roves an O'Brien contest to a Smith inside 50 kick and gives back to O'Brien who snaps wide from 30m on a slight angle. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 23:28)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Greene gives away a free in the BP for decking Sicily&#044; the Hawks sweep around the outer wing and Scully kicks the goal from the pocket. That feels very much like the crucial play. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 18:12)</span><br />
