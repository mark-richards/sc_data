#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Waite takes the intercept mark on the 50m arc. He pops it up to the hot spot&#044; landing with Andrew Swallow. With minimal angle&#044; he kicks the easy goal. Too little&#044; too late. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Joe Daniher&#044; who's been relatively quiet&#044; crumbs a pack and snaps from 45. His shot stays low&#044; but goes through the big sticks to extend the margin. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 31:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: To ice the Bombers' cake&#044; Stewart lines up for his second of the day. He misses left.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Essendon continue to pull away in this last quarter. A Parish clearance gets to Zaharakis who kicks truly on the run from 45m. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Laverde turns it over in the middle&#044; the ball is collected by Swallow&#044; who finds Ben Brown inside 50 with another quality contested mark. From 40 on a slight angle&#044; he goals. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:54)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Atley uses his speed to burst down the wing and kick it long to the advantage of Brown&#044; who marks. From 45m on the boundary&#044; his kick goes across the face for a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The Bombers go back to back with another quick goal through Parish. After receiving the handball from Laverde&#044; Darcy slots it from 45 on the run. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Hooker marks a quick&#044; high Parish clearance kick. An easy shot then becomes a certainty as a frustrated Nielsen gives away the 50m penalty. Margin out to 22.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Dumont centres the footy to the top of the square&#044; eventually picked up by Waite who sells some candy&#044; sells some more&#044; and kicks the goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Laverde hands the footy off to Zaharakis who shoots from just outside 50. His kick clears the pack but bounces into the post.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:10)</span><br />
