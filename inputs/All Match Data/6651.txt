Dominant all round today. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Impey goes long to Henderson who waits&#044; waits&#044; waits&#044; and then pokes it to Roughy. From inside the arc&#044; his shot is left.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Ed Curnow fights hard in the hot spot for his team.
