#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Port bully their way through the corridor&#044; resulting in a last-minute goal to Rockliff who made no mistake with his right-foot snap. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:51)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Riewoldt marks on the lead and will line up for his fourth of the afternoon. Jack shoots from 40 and just misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Short dashes through the corridor before Stack collects the loose ball inside 50. He waits to release to Rioli who steps inboard and snaps truly.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Prestia's kick to the pocket is clunked strongly by Lynch above the pack. This time&#044; he hits the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Lynch marks on the flank and tries to move it quickly but falls over&#044; meaning that he's forced to shoot on goal. From 45m&#044; it's to the near side.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A hack kick forward from Cotchin falls favourably into the lap of Sydney Stack. He goes back&#044; shoots from 40m&#044; directly in front&#044; and just misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:04)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Cotchin is penalised for a throw thanks to persistent Rozee pressure. The youngster elects for the checkside from the pocket but misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A hasty kick amongst a swarm of players from Sutcliffe sails over the goal umpire's head&#044; but it's far too little&#044; too late for Port. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:49)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Butters marks while Houston lays almost motionless just behind him&#044; causing a little bit of chaos and confusion. Nevertheless&#044; he takes the shot from 40m and misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Riewoldt sends a long bomb inside 50 to the Martin-Hartlett contest&#044; where Edwards collects off hands at full speed and boots it into the top rows. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:48)</span><br />
