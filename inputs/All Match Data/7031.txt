#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The Dogs hold out against an onslaught of last-minute Geelong pressure. Lloyd has the last kick of the match and smacks it straight through the middle. Woof woof! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Trengove turns it over to Hawkins who snaps accurately from the pocket&#044; giving the Cats a minor sniff with just under two minutes on the clock. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Rohan marks on the leads and shoots from 45&#044; but again it's offline. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:08)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: McLean collects off hands and has the opportunity to put the game almost beyond doubt&#044; but his quick shot from 40 is offline. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:51)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: It's Bailey Smith with the front-and-centre snap that sends the Doggies out to a 16-point margin.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:24)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: B.Smith&#044; R. Smith&#044; Lloyd and then Hunter is the last link in the handball chain. On his better side&#044; Hunter sprays the shot through for a behind.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:24)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Bontempelli bombs it toward Naughton and Tuohy deep in attack. It comes to ground where Naughton is first to recover. He gathers and drills the goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:09)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: McLean emerges from congestion and kicks to the advantage of the Bont in the square. He marks&#044; kicks the goal&#044; and puts the Dogs in front! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Naughton's influence is evident&#044; provided with another opportunity at goal. This one's a set shot that misses to the left from 45m. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:23)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: McLean links up with Lloyd who spots Naughton in a paddock of space. This time&#044; from 35m he makes no mistake. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:06)</span><br />
