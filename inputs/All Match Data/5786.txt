#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Crows move it long to the hot spot. Eddie gathers&#044; boundary side and in matter of moments manages to float it through from the mission impossible angle! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Boak receives from Pittard and moves it off to Broadbent out of the stoppage. Matt receives and hammers it through from 55! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Sloane sets it to the top of the square with a punt. Walker flies and no one goes with him&#044; allowing Taylor the uncontested grab. Taylor slots it from 20 on the slight angle! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Gray to Westhoff who hoofs it inside forward 50. Amon plays a vital role once more&#044; this time finding it and chipping it back to Broadbent. Matt misses the acute shot from 40. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Amon grabs the quick reply! The Power move forward through Ebert and Karl played the role of crumber&#044; spinning in and out of traffic before snapping truly from 35! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:08)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Toumpas turns it over through the corridor&#044; flicking it into traffic and the ball popped the way of McGovern. Mitch gathered and hammers home from 45 on the slight! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:08)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Amon reads it off the hands of Young&#044; as Schulz sent the Power forward with the 50 metre entry. Karl hammers it on the boot&#044; but could only dribble it through for a minor from 30. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Douglas chips it to Mackay who marks ahead of the attempted spoiler in Toumpas. David lines up from 35 on the flank and misses to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:22)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Walker grabs it off the deck&#044; spins for home and slams it on the right peg in trademark fashion. For a moment it appears to be sailing home&#044; but alas it's a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Crouch&#044; Douglas and finally Jenkins as Richard darted one onto his teammates chest. Josh kicks from 55 on the flank and misses to the far side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:40)</span><br />
