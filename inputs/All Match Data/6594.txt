#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Lambert launches to the isolated contest between the undersized Dea and Moore. The predictable outcome occurs and Moore nails the set shot from 35 on the slight! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Moore forces the turnover deep in defence with a strong tackle on Guelfi. Conca takes the intercept mark and Reece lines up from 40 on the flank. He pulls it to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:24)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Ellis&#044; Graham&#044; Grigg and finally Riewoldt link by hand and foot&#044; resulting in a set shot from 45. Jack lines up the set shot and makes no mistake! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:36)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Tipungwuti dabs the pass short to Smith and Devon will line up from 45 on the flank. The former Giant shoots and kicks truly for his first! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:06)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Heppell slides into the contest and take Cotchin's legs with him&#044; duly punished with the free against. Trent shoots from 45 on the flank and misses to the far side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:34)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Menadue extends the Tigers lead beyond the ten goal margin! Connor receives through the middle of the ground&#044; took three bounces and dabs it through from 30! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 28:53)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Jack Graham's effort from beyond the arc falls short. A scrimmage ensues and Nankervis is the unlikely winner&#044; soccering it truly off the deck from point blank! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 26:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: McKenna makes the error through the corridor&#044; flicking to Guelfi who is immediately wrapped up. The Tigers efficiently find Moore unopposed&#044; although Callum is unable to goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 25:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: If they weren't before&#044; the Tigers are home and hosed! Butler breaks the tackle&#044; forces the ball to ground level and then repeats later on to goal from close range! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 18:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Moore takes the strong lead up grab and will line up from beyond the arc. The third gamer shoots from the flank region and pulls it slightly to the near side for a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 16:40)</span><br />
