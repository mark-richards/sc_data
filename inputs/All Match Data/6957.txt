#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A last-second free kick and goal to Greene puts the icing on the cake. GIants&#044; sing your song.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:53)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Bruce misses a set shot from 40m to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:53)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Daniels marks inside 50 and dishes off to a running De Boer. The veteran splits the middle from 45.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Kent marks the Newnes kick on the flank and lines up for another goal. He has no trouble.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:24)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Coniglio and Finlayson combine under pressure. Cameron sidesteps and kicks across the body on his left from 40. It's close to the post&#044; but it squeezes through for a goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:09)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Cameron marks millimetres inside the field of play. On the right side for a left-footer&#044; his snap is OOTF. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:54)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Sinclair strides through the corridor and hits Kent free in some space. His attempt from 45m on a 45-degree angle narrowly misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Gresham's terrible kick is powdered with luck as it falls into the hands of Kent&#044; 25m out. Dean's kick sails over the goal umpire's hat.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:08)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Mumford gives away his 9th free kick of the day&#044; this time for high contact in a stoppage. Marshall works the breeze in his favour as he lines up from 45 and kicks the goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:41)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: 50m is paid against McKenzie for a late hit and the Giants aren't happy about it. Lloyd kicks the easiest of goals from point blank.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:32)</span><br />
