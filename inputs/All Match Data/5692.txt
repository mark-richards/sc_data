#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Tyson wins the one on one opposed to Smith&#044; fending and fighting off the Hawk for the contested ball. Dom flicks it inside to Vandenberg&#044; who misses the open play attempt from 40. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hill finds O'Brien unmarked&#044; boundary side&#044; 40 metres out from the big sticks. Tim takes his time and then manages to split the middle with a tremendous effort! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:28)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Gunston takes the grab and then launches long to the Jetta/Rioli contest. Cyril forced it to ground&#044; Puopolo found it at ground level and snapped truly from deep in the pocket! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:35)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hill hits it off the deck with the soccered effort after the Hawks managed to force a turnover in the forward 50. Brad's attempt just went the wrong way of the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Breust with a brilliant play&#044; managing to keep it in on the boundary side&#044; then centred to Stewart with the flick through the corridor. Kade receives and snaps truly! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Jones finds Harmes unopposed inside 50&#044; after standing by himself for a seemingly immeasurable amount of time. From 45 on the flank&#044; James just misses to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The first gamer&#044; Kade Stewart receives a free kick after ducking into Harmes' attempted tackle. Questionable decision&#044; and Kade misses poorly from 35 on the slight. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Scores are level as we head into an ever important final term for these two clubs. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 29:22)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Howe to Birchall to Breust&#044; with Luke marking unopposed&#044; 40 out on the flank. The small forward has had trouble with his set shots today&#044; but sends that one through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 26:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Frost takes Sicily high in the attempted tackle&#044; and the Hawks number 21 will line up the set shot from the boundary&#044; 45 out. His snap effort is pulled to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 25:29)</span><br />
