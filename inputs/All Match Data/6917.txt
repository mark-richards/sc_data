#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Bontempelli almost puts the icing on the cake with a long bomb to a vacant square. But Isaac Smith touches it on the line just in time. Game over. Dogs win. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 32:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: McLean kicks it to the one-on-one of Gowers and Sicily. Gowers had the advantage and as a result&#044; Sicily gave away the free. 50m for umpire abuse takes Gowers to the goal line. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Following a stoppage in the forward pocket&#044; Libba puts the Dogs two goals up! It was an unconventional yet effective left-foot snap.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:37)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Sicily is penalised for very soft off-the-ball aggression. It takes the footy from the centre circle all the way to the Dogs' hot spot. Schache goals from directly in front. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Worpel gives away a strange free kick in the centre circle for not vacating the space. The dogs work it forward&#044; Macrae picks up the crumbs and goals from 40. Scores are level! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Bontempelli does exceptionally well to crash the pack and then distribute the footy. McLean picks up the loose ball&#044; spins onto his right and snaps the goal from 25. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:51)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: English lines up from about 54. He gives it a massive roost but sacrifices accuracy for distance. Minor score only. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Macrae hands to McLean who kicks inside 50 to the advantaged side of Dickson. He marks over Stratton&#044; goes back&#044; and slots the goal from the pocket. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Scully gives to O'Meara on the run&#044; but his attempt on goal from 45 is just left of the big sticks. Through for a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q2 8:53)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Following a Bailey Smith pass&#044; Schache will go again from an almost identical spot. Schache's kick this time is flawless. Goal to the Doggies. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q2 8:53)</span><br />
