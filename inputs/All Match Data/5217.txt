#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The BOMBERS ARE HOME!

Jordan found Breust out the back&#044; who goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hill taps it out of congestion to Hodge who finds Burgoyne. Shaun belts it onto Roughead's leading chest ahead of Hurley. From 50 on the flank&#044; Jarryd makes it 12 the difference! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Baguley gets tackled by Puopolo under brilliant pressure and the ball fumbles out to Breust who gets the quick kick out of the congestion true&#044; slotting it from 20! Hawks in front! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Hawks work it forward through sheer pressure and it ends with Puopolo who misses the snap from 30 on the flank to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: McEvoy to Ceglar to Burgoyne to Breust. Luke looks inside but saw nothing on offer so he went for goal but missed to the near side from 35 on the flank. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Rioli to Puopolo back to Rioli who shrugs a tackle and chips it to Hill unmanned in the goal square. Brad makes it a 2 point ball game! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:45)</span><br />
