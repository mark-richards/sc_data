#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Hawkins marks in front of two Dogs at much the same spot as the last set shot&#044; and repeats the dose with a screwing set shot this time. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Hawkins marks over Roberts in the pocket 20m out and boots goal number three. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:19)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Gregson to Menzel with a Joe the Goose special on the end of a coast to coast rebound from the last line.
