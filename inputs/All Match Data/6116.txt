#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Kreuzer gives away the free kick for holding Nankervis in the marking contest. The former Swan lines up the simple shot from 20 out and makes no mistake! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Menadue launches to the hotspot and Riewoldt takes it down on the second grab. Spectacular grab from the Tigers key forward. Jack misses the sharp angle shot. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:19)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Ellis&#044; Grigg and Caddy link by hand after Jones' kick was unable to clear the danger. The former Cat shoots from 45 on the sharp angle and misses to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:21)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Gibbs&#044; Smedts and Murphy link by hand through the middle of the MCG before Marc sends it long to the one on one against Martin. Patrick takes the strong mark and goals from 30! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Pickett drops the uncontested mark inside 30. The Tigers waltz it down the other end and Butler marks in the goal square. He finishes truly and that was an emphatic 12 point swing. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:21)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Murphy to Graham and Nick creates a second score assist in the matter of moments&#044; finding Charlie Curnow. Curnow took the strong grab and goals from 35 on the flank! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cripps to Graham and the fringe Blue sends it inside 50 where Simpson manages to track the flight of the ball and take the grab. Kade shoots from 40 on the slight and misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cotchin wins the pill from the resultant stoppage and manages to float the mongrel punt into the arms of the unmarked Riewoldt. Jack shoots from 45 on the slight and nails it!  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:57)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Martin to Prestia and Dion darts the ball onto the chest of Butler. Daniel trots in and makes no mistake from 35 metres out on the slight angle! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Grimes produces a terrible error deep in defence&#044; sending it over the fence when a rushed behind was a possibility. Gibbs takes the free kick and misses to the far side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 1:20)</span><br />
