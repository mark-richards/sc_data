#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Richards marks out the back as the Roos continue to squander their chances moving into the forward 50. Xavier kicks from 45 on the flank and misses to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:04)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Swallow sends it long to the hot spot and Ziebell is the one that receives after Brown brings it to ground. Jack shoots on the run&#044; but misses from 35 on the slight angle. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:08)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Franklin receives and burns off Firrito&#044; powering to the 50 on the boundary side akin to those Hooker moments so long ago. The shot misses to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:44)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Franklin&#044; Richards and then McGlynn&#044; all by foot before Ben dabbed it further afield to the hard running Hannebery. Daniel shoots from 50 on the flank and slots it! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:51)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Swans transition at pace&#044; with Rohan receiving in the middle of Blundstone and immediately blazes down the other end. He hits the post from 55. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Aliir produces a terrible turnover&#044; attempting to move it centrally and thus allowing Harvey to intercept the pass. That Brent does&#044; and he misses the shot from 40 on the slight. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:08)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cunnington wins the clearance from the stoppage and whacks it on the boot for the speedy shot. Ben's attempt misses to the left hand side from 30 on the slight. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Wells sets it up to the hotspot. Daw flies&#044; allowing Dal Santo to force Parker to turn it over at ground level with a smother. Harvey anticipates and goals from close range! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Parker receives out of the forward 50 stoppage and immediately sends the pill goalward. Luke's attempt misses to the right hand side from 30. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 0:41)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Rampe wins the one on one&#044; then bolts away from the North pressure without a moments hesitation. Dane launches&#044; boundary side only a step inside the arc&#044; and scores a minor. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 31:03)</span><br />
