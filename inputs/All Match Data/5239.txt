#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: THE DOGS HOLD ON FOR AN INCREDIBLE WIN! What a game of football that was! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: HROVAT! Takes it out of congestion but his shot just misses to the right hand side from 35. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Just over 3 minutes left on the clock. Dogs holding on with their 3 point lead and with the ball in the forward end of the ground for the away side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Jong wins the clearance and his kick forward lands in the outstretched arms of Stringer&#044; ahead of the desperate Richards. It's thumped through for a minor from 55! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Dahlhaus hacks it forward out of extreme congestion&#044; and Wood soccers it home from the goal line with pressure coming from Ladler! Dogs back in the lead! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:10)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: CUNNINGHAM! Finally the Swans grab the lead. Parker's shot gets smothered but Bird works the ball out to Cunningham&#044; who snaps across his body from 25 out. It bounces through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Jetta to Lloyd to McVeigh&#044; who snaps quickly from the pocket to the roar of the Swans crowd! Unfortunately for them&#044; the shot has missed to the far side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:10)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hannebery goes long to the Talia/Franklin matchup and Lance wins it on the bounce. He turns at speed&#044; launching goalward&#044; but his shot from 45 misses to the right hand side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:57)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Ladler bombs in long to the Tippett/Robets matchup and Kurt takes the strong grab. He lines up from 35 on the slight&#044; and incredibly hits the woodwork. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Parker barges through the contest with ball in hand and finds Jack with a hand pass waiting on the outside. Kieran receives&#044; turns and slams it home from 25 on the snap! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:13)</span><br />
