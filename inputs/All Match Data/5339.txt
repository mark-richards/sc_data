#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Ibbotson takes a massive intercept mark down the middle and finds Mundy with a drilling pass. David lines up from 50 on the slight with only 30 seconds left. MUNDY GOALS! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Pavlich takes a bullish mark out ahead of McPharlin 60 out from goal and finds Sheridan through the corridor unopposed. From 45&#044; directly in front&#044; he MISSES! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Deledio finds Riewoldt on the lead ahead of McPharlin&#044; and Jack will line up from 40 out on the flank. He trots in and misses to the far side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: This time Cotchin receives the free in congestion against Mundy in what was clearly a horrendous decision. From 40 out&#044; Trent misses the LOT! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Chaplin gives away another free kick off the ball&#044; this time for pushing the man to ground. Crozier goes back and sends it through from 50 on the boundary&#044; incredible finish! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Chaplin goes inside 50 with a horrible hit but it goes straight onto the chest of Lennon&#044; who marks out in front. From 45 on the slight&#044; Ben kicks his second! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Houli to Ellis to Martin all by foot as the Tigers opened up their counterparts with precise ball movement&#044; and now Dustin will line up from 45 on the flank. He hits the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:46)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Walters gets it out the back with a bouncing delivery to the hard running Barlow. Michael runs onto it ahead of Hunt and nabs it from point blank range! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Martin to Maric who goes long and it bounces onto the POST! The Tigers were nearly delirious after that monster from outside 50. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: In a highly dubious decision&#044; Pavlich receives the free kick for holding against Rance. Matthew goes back and nails the major from 30 on the slight angle! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:57)</span><br />
