#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Betts marks in front of McDonald at about 40&#044; but he can't align his shot the way he would have liked. It's wide for a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Ziebell is hemmed up on the boundary within scoring range. He elects to run around with the right-foot banana. It's just across the face for a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A holding free kick is paid to Taylor Walker. The big Texan has no trouble kicking it through the big sticks from 35. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Jenkins marks a long kick on the line&#044; then somehow misses from point-blank range...  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: North waste another couple of opportunities in quick succession&#044; first via a Goldstein snap&#044; then a Polec grubber. Both shots were close but only registered minor scores.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:23)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: It's back to back goals for North&#044; this time through Zurhaar. The footy cleared a pack of players&#044; Cam ran onto it&#044; and he kicked a relatively simple goal.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:22)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Ziebell links with Goldstein who connects with a running Hall. His kick to the hot spot is clunked by Cunnington who has no trouble slotting the goal from close range. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:22)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: O'Brien is way too slow in his attempt to release from defence. Turner makes him pay&#044; catching the big man HTB. His shot from 45 on a slight angle misses right. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 27:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Ziebell and Turner combine in the pocket&#044; with the latter showing poise to laterally find Brown on the lead. To make it five consecutive goals&#044; Brown's 35m shot is offline.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 22:06)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Talia is penalised for holding Brown's jumper. He tries to plead his case to no avail. Brown makes it four in a row for the Roos as North hit the lead! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 20:51)</span><br />
