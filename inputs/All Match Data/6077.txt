#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Game&#044; set&#044; match&#044; but not the way you would have expected at half time. The quick kick out of the stoppage falls to Smith. Josh gathers and belts it through from 45! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Gunston marks out on the lead as the Hawks have just four minutes to play to overturn the unlikely deficit. Called to play on&#044; Jack hooks his effort for a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:13)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Crisp&#044; Pendlebury&#044; Blair&#044; Hoskin-Elliot and Sidebottom link as the Magpies seek an opening within the F50. Steele receives&#044; doubles back and snaps it through from 45! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Vickery is left wanting in the chase effort and the afforded time proves decisive. Pendlebury receives on the HF flank&#044; he waltzes through the arc and slots it off the left! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Magpies have hit the lead. Pendlebury receives after the reflex tap came his way from Moore. Scott flicks off to Elliott and Jamie sends through his third from point blank! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: McEvoy predictably wins the aerial contest on centre wing opposed to Elliott. He sends it long and Breust is the recipient. Luke receives from Howe and snaps truly from 20! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:49)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The scores are tied at the MCG! Crisp takes the mark inside 50 on the sharp angle via the Elliott pass. Jack shoots and manages to split the middle from the set shot! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 30:25)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Henderson turns it over across the HF flank and the distribution proves decisive. The Magpies waltz out the back and Moore powers into the unguarded goal! 6 point difference! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 28:53)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Pendlebury&#044; Adams&#044; Elliott and the Pies are within two and a half goals! Jamie waltzes into the open goal and sends it through to rapturous applause from their faithful! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 20:35)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Roughead produces a catastrophic error&#044; turning it over whilst kicking backwards. Moore is the recipient&#044; taking the high flying grab just moments later. Darcy goals from 45! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 10:24)</span><br />
