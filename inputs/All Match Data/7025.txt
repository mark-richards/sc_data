#####<em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Brisbane turn the ball over in the middle of the ground&#044; allowing Brayshaw to find McDonald in space 30m out. McDonald misses to the left. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:08)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Rayner kicks out in front of McCarthy who marks&#044; runs to 45m and kicks a nice running goal to shut the door on the Demons. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Hore turns it over badly coming out of defence and it finishes with Zorko who is able to run into an open goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:53)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Hipwood has a long shot at goal; it comes off the side of the boot but Robinson is able to mark 20m out in the pocket. Robinson goals. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: McDonald marks 40m out and plays on quickly&#044; finding Hannan 20m out who snaps the goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:39)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Hipwood's everywhere. Neale kicks long and Hipwood manages to hang on before it crosses the behind post. He goes back and snaps his fifth goal in about 30 minutes! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 1:36)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Martin boots it forward and Cameron manages to release Christensen by hand&#044; and Christensen kicks a nice running goal. Plenty of action in Q3! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 29:37)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Viney capitalises on a Brisbane mistake and shows good composure to slot a goal from a standing start 40m out. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 28:37)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Hipwood kicks his third for the term! This time it's from a set short on the boundary where he arcs around and snaps magnificently. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 26:23)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Hipwood involved again as he marks 45m from goal. He goes back&#044; launches on his left foot and it soars through for another Lions goal to put them in front. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 21:38)</span><br />
