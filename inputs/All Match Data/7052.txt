#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Eagles are home through another clutch Dom Sheed goal! Fritsch misses the central target&#044; Dom gets released and bounces it through from 45! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:46)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: After Preuss drops an uncontested attempt in scoring range&#044; Petty butters up catching Barrass in the stranglehold. He receives the free and Harrison duly converts from 30! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: May turns the ball over from the kick-in&#044; his short pass failing to hit the intended target. Sheed gathers the loose pill&#044; failing to make it count with a snap from 35. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The ball is launched long by Redden&#044; appearing to go to an unmarked May. However&#044; the ball has a mind of its own&#044; bouncing back into the path of Kennedy. Josh misses on the fly. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The league's premier big man pulls the ball in and is wrapped up by Darling&#044; the free rewarded to the tackler. Jack kicks his second in as many minutes from 25! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Darling takes the grab from close range and converts&#044; regaining the lead for the reigning premiers! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:14)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: It may prove a handy point&#044; the Dees taking the lead with that score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:21)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Melbourne fly from the resultant stoppage through Corey Wagner. Corey runs his full measure and thumps his effort from the arc goalward. His shot misses to the right hand side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:46)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Eagles work it wide via the Rioli handball. Gaff is the recipient&#044; moving it to the wing with a dab pass to Yeo. Elliot marks&#044; rounds Frost and goals from the arc! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Lewis leads McGovern a merry dance and looks further afield in a flash. Jordan darts the pass and finds the hard running Oliver. Clayton marks and converts from the sharp angle! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 27:56)</span><br />
