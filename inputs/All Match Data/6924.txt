#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: With 7 seconds on the clock&#044; Beams snaps a nice goal over his left shoulder. Too little&#044; too late. Well done Eagles.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 31:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Treloar's snap is smothered by Barrass. Thomas picks up the scraps but his dribbler is knocked over the line for a minor score.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:28)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Free kick West Coast. Petruccelle takes the advantage&#044; runs into an open goal&#044; and blasts it toward the clouds.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Josh Kennedy all but seals the deal for the Eagles with a left foot snap from the top of the square. Ryan cleverly worked the ball forward to his teammate's advantage.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: De Goey gives the Pies a sniff with a quick snap goal after crumbing a hot-spot contest.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Pendlebury spots Elliott on the run inside Collingwood's forward 50. Jamie shows composure to centre it to the advantage of Phillips who takes a stellar mark. But he can't convert. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:09)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Jetta picks up the loose ball and launches it inside 50. Cripps slips over but finds his feet&#044; steps around Crisp&#044; and snaps the goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: It's GF deja vu as Ryan kicks to Sheed inside 50. His attempt from 40 on a 45-degree angle is flawless. Eagles stretch their lead. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: HTB against Jetta and Treloar will have the opportunity to put the Pies back in contention with a set shot from 42. He's hooked it and it barely scrapes in for a point.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: He's been quiet all night&#044; but Jamie Elliott pounces and goals when it counts most. He pushed off his opponent on the HFF&#044; charged inside 50 and kicked truly on the run from 40.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:14)</span><br />
