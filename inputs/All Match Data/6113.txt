#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: FINAL SIREN! The Bulldogs hold on in another heart stopper! Classic affair with the Roos mounting a late charge that demonstrated remarkable effort when all seemed lost. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Bontempelli wins the ball in the middle of the ground and forces it forward. 24 seconds remaining... <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Stringer has a shot for goal as the Bulldogs tear down the other end from the kick in. Jake shoots from 45 on the flank&#044; and he misses to take the lead. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:51)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Higgins wins it at the coalface and throws it on the boot with immediacy from the forward stoppage. The up and under falls through for a minor score. Tied ball game. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:28)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Two and a half minutes to play. One point ball game. Can the Dogs hold on once again? Or do North make it two fantastic comebacks in one exhilarating weekend? <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Daw launches himself at the ball after the long ball by Mullett. Majak forces it forward and Cunnington waits forward and centre. Ben gathers and nabs a second in the last five! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:08)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Five minutes and eighteen seconds left of playing time. North with the last three. Seven point margin. Both seasons on the line. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:51)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Brown lofts the pill to the leading Daw and Majak takes the strong grab ahead of Roughead. Majak lines up and sends through his second of the contest! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Redpath gives away the off the ball free kick and the turnover proves decisive. Brown marks inside the arc and chips further afield to the marking Waite. Jarrad goals from 25! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Suckling is forced into turnover once more&#044; this time by hand. Cunnington receives out of congestion and shoots with the snap from the sharp angle. He scores a minor. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:25)</span><br />
