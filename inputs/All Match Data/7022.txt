#####<em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Pendlebury goes long to Cox who is one out in the square against Durdin. He juggles the mark. Cox puts it through to make the scoreline look slightly more respectable. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Zurhaar marks 50 out of the flank. He goes long to the tip of the square where Larkey rises to mark basically uncontested. He pops it through. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Wood marks on the wing and finds Zurhaar in the pocket in front of Mayne. The shot at goal drops short but is spoiled forward where Davies-Uniacke is lurking. He roves and goals. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Grundy takes it out of the ruck in the hot spot and has a snap at goal. Tarrant rushes it across the line. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Atley steals a mark from Phillips on the wing. He lands on his feet and plays on&#044; finding Davies-Uniacke with the handball. From 40 out Davies-Uniacke has a ping and goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:44)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: The Kangaroos chain some slick handballs down the wing and it ends with Ziebell. From 40 out he has a shot at goal but misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:44)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Collingwood work it well down the corridor from defence. A long handball puts Mihocek under pressure inside 50 and he can only manage a wild snap which hits the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:29)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: North Melbourne get the centre clearance through Simpkin. He hits a leading Brown who can't mark with pressure from Roughead. Brown crumbs and snaps from 40 but manages a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(3 Qtr Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Cunnington roves a pack at half forward and shovels it to Anderson. He sends a kick across the ground to Polec who marks running back into space. From 30 out he goals. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 29:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Roughead tries charging out of defence after a poor kick from Maynard puts him under heavy pressure. The ball is turned over and ends with Zurhaar. His ping from 40 misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 26:55)</span><br />
