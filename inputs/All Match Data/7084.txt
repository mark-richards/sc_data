#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: In an attempt to rub salt into the would&#044; Hoskin-Elliott lines up after the siren but hits the woodwork. Game over! Comprehensive win for the Pies. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Callum Brown's entry kick is marked by Mayne within the last minute but his 35m shot is narrowly wide.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 31:28)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Callum Brown dinks a pass into the lap of Josh Thomas who starts his run-up from 55 and splits the middle.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:13)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: It's junk time goals galore&#044; this time through Taylor Adams who snaps truly from 35 off the back of some quality forward pressure from Hoskin-Elliott.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Phillips roves the Roughead contest and has time to settle onto his left boot before slotting the drop punt from 40 on the run.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Varcoe marks at CHF and but it's called not-15&#044; so he quickly plays on and sends it toward goal from the arc. The result... marginally wide.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:14)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Howe finds himself in space at half-forward but elects not to shoot&#044; instead passing short to Elliott. Jamie plays on and snaps on his right but it barely scrapes in for a point.   <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:23)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Jacobs puts a strong tackle on Scharenberg and is rewarded for it. His kick into the 50 is clunked by Fogarty who puts through his third of the day from 40.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:28)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Douglas roves the pack in the hot spot&#044; popping a handball over the top to Fogarty who kicks the simple goal.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The Pies waste no time going end to end&#044; with Treloar offloading to Hoskin-Elliott who finishes with ease from 30 on the run.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:43)</span><br />
