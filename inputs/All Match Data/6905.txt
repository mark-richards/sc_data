#####<em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: The Swans turn it over coming out of their defensive 50. Libba gathers and fires a wild shot through for a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:22)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: The Dogs get a second in quick succession! After getting the centre clearance they lock it in their forward pocket. It eventually spills out to Lloyd who snaps the goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:22)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: The ball goes to ground from a contest on the wing and the Dogs rove it! Bontempelli leads the race back to the goal square. He marks a McLean kick and runs into an open goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: The Swans are locking it into their attacking 50 with extreme pressure. This time a poor kick lands with Jones. He sets sail from 50 and just misses! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:21)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: The Swans go end to end and find Buddy 1 on 1 with Wood. Jones finds Buddy who takes a strong mark against his direct opponent. His shot hits the post! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: A quick kick goes inside the Bulldogs' 50. Melican makes contact with Schache and concedes the free kick for a push. From 30 out Schache misses to the left. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:09)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Blakey and Wood contest on the wing. The ball goes to ground but Blakey wins out. He goes long to the hot spot where Buddy is free! Buddy rolls it through! 5 points in it! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:06)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Hewett finds Parker in the pocket. He then centres to Hayward 30 out from goal. Hayward's set shot goes out to the right for a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:54)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: English concedes a free kick at the centre bounce. The Swans go inside 50 where it comes off hands to Heeney. He gives to Papley who shimmies and pops it through from 30! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:19)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Koss</em>: Reid drops a sitter in the pocket after pushing off his man. Luckily he has enough time to gather and handball over the top to Heeney. He pokes it through from point blank. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:04)</span><br />
