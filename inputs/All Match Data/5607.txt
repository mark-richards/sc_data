#####<em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Pittard charging through the middle kicks to Dixon in a one-on-one with Roberton. Dixon's far too big and Roberton gives away the free. The kick from the top of the square is good. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:36)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Dixon's had a huge influence in the last term. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:35)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Wingard pressure's Fisher into a kick out on the full. Dixon takes the free kick from 55m and kicks a long goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:35)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: This time it's Port who get out the back. Impey kicks long and Wingard has too much pace for Dempster and he kicks the goal on the run from 20m. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Boak sends Port inside 50 again&#044; it comes to Wingard who chips nicely inboard to Robbie Gray who snaps the goal. That might put Port out of St Kilda's reach now. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Port win the centre clearance&#044; the long kick in falls to Westhoff who turns his man around and kicks the goal on the run! 16 points the margin with 8 minutes remaining. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Ebert with the ball 40m out and a reckless tackle from Newnes results in a free kick for high contact. Ebert goes back&#044; kicks truly and slots his 3rd for the day. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:04)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Acres shanks a kick out on the full on the way out of defence. Hartlett takes the free kick 50m out on a strong angle. He misses the set shot to the far side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:37)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Long kick from Jonas&#044; Schulz jumps early and takes a huge mark! But his set shot from 45m out misses to the left. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Boak wins a tough contest&#044; hands to Polec who runs to 50 but sprays the shot on goal and it sneaks in for a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:00)</span><br />
