#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: With a minute left&#044; Lynch blasts his 6th goal from 50! He puts the Tigers 7 points up.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: It's a huge mark to young Duursma who will feel the pressure to put his team back in front. From 30&#044; he sprays it. 1 point the difference.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Castagna roves a busy pack and feeds it by hand to McIntosh. He throws it on the left boot and his snap bounces fortunately&#044; putting the Tigers back in front! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Grimes does well to intercept the ball coming in&#044; but then turns it straight back over to Houston on the rebound. He kicks truly from 50 and puts the Power back in front!  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:29)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Lambert pumps the footy forward to a genuine two-on-two inside Richmond's 50. Caddy can't hold the mark but then mops up his own mess and soccers the footy through the goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:28)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Stack milks the free kick for light contact&#044; then butchers it OOTF. Port then work it to the hot spot where Ollie Wines eventually snaps the goal from inside the square.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:14)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Balta's tackle lingers on Drew who draws the free and will line up from 35. He has no trouble converting when it counts! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Lycett finds Butters all on his own inside his attacking 50. The youngster lines up and kicks from the 50 arc. It's knuckled over the line for a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Lynch marks on the wing and plays on... but the umpire doesn't call it and thus a 50m penalty is paid for crossing over the mark. From 44m with no real angle&#044; he kicks the goal!  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:57)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Front-on contact is paid against Duursma as Rioli flew for the mark. Daniel pushes his 35m set shot to the right and that's where it stays.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:59)</span><br />
