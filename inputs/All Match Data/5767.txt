#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Goldstein and Roughead fly at the pill and Jordan gives away the free kick for chopping the arms. Todd goes back and sends it through for 2 in a minute! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Ziebell wins a free kick at the stoppage and with just 9 minutes left to play&#044; this is a must kick shot. Jack trots in and finishes with ease&#044; 35 out from the flank region! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:41)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Harvey can't trap the ball as it bounces through his legs&#044; enabling Boyd to grab it and move it off to Picken. Liam dabs the pass to Stringer&#044; and Jake finishes with class from 40! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:04)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Wells takes it out of the forward stoppage and in a kung fu type move&#044; he manages to get ball to boot in a split second. Daniel finishes truly from close range! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Long bomb to the hotspot and Roughead takes another contested mark&#044; this time opposed to Petrie. Jordan lines up the set shot and sends it through from 30 on the slight! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Johanissen sends the delivery inside 50 and a highly dubious mark is paid Webb's way&#044; even after clearly being touched by Firrito. From the set shot&#044; Lucas misses to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 24:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hrovat chips it over the top to the hard working Cordy&#044; who marks unopposed 45 metres out from goal. Zaine kicks from the flank region and sends it straight through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 23:04)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Firrito is the next veteran to turn it over poorly in defence&#044; but this time the opponent makes them pay. Hunter received from the errant handball and finished truly from 45! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 19:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Morris produces a horrible turnover through the middle of the ground and it enabled the Roos to speed down the other side. That they do&#044; but Anderson misses the set shot from 40. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 17:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Petrie marks and immediately surveys the options&#044; before punting in a low effort to the leading Thomas. Lindsay takes the chest mark and finishes from 40 on the slight! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 14:47)</span><br />
