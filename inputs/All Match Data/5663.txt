#####<em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Christensen hacks the ball off the ground directly to the boundary line and is pinged for deliberate.

He's been impressive once again today. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Darius</em>: Ball gets out the back&#044; Zorko runs onto and manages to get boot to ball for a soccer and just sneaks it home. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:18)</span><br />
