#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: And there you have it&#044; folks - North Melbourne's lowest score in history.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Wood marks over Ablett smack on the 50 and will go back and shoot for goal. He sprays it OOTF... <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:10)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Narkle's front and centre work is as good as it gets&#044; collecting and snapping truly from 40. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:09)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Ratugolea gets a quick snap away from the 20m stoppage but it's overcooked&#044; through for a minor score.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:06)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: 19 points is North Melbourne's lowest EVER total score. If they don't kick a goal in the last 5 minutes&#044; a new record will be set.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:57)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Atkins pokes a 15m pass into the line of Hawkins who marks at 45&#044; shoots from 50 and nails it.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:54)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Dangerfield ices what's been a stellar individual performance with a long bomb from 52 that sails over the goal umpire's hat.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Guthrie steers it wide to a leading Hawkins who was given far too much space. Tom shoots from 45 on a moderate angle and misses to the near side.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:10)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Dangerfield catches Higgins high at the other end which will give Shaun a chance to makes amends. After the 3QT siren&#044; his shot drops short. No score.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(3 Qtr Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Higgins drops the mark in his own defensive 50 which allows for the turnover. Miers makes the most of the opportunity&#044; snapping it through from 40 for his third of the evening.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 28:12)</span><br />
