#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Zorko gains a late consolation prize for the Lions. Young&#044; Crozier and Honeychurch get drawn to the ball. Dayne waits eagerly out the back&#044; gathers the spill and goals with ease! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:09)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Bontempelli launches from the resultant clearance and McLean is the one to stay at ground level. Toby opportunistically gathers off the deck and finishes from close range! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Lions run it up the corridor and find a mark through the diving McStay&#044; ahead of the desperate Cordy. Daniel shoots from 30 and slots the set shot! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:21)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Suckling marks wide of the play via the Macrae pass&#044; the former Hawk marking 55 out from goal. Matt lines up and thumps it home like few in the league could! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Bontempelli marks out the back after the Taylor turnover costs the Lions dearly. Dale gathered the loose handball and Marcus makes it count! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:10)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cutler bounds down the wing and launches out the back to find the speeding Cameron. Young fails to affect the contest and the goal is duly converted! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Zorko launches from the arc and Cordy flies to get a fist to the ball. The ball flies through and no review is called. Dayne brings the old Fitzroy back within 3 goals. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Dunkley and Eagles battle it out in the isolated contest and Josh wins out. He holds his feet&#044; gathers and finishes from point blank range! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:54)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: McLean releases Suckling with a stutter step and speedy hands. Matt runs his measure&#044; but lets the Lions off the hook with a poor effort from 35. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Dale receives in an acre of space as the Lions fail in their attempts to rebound defence. Bailey settles on the shot under little pressure&#044; but fails to send it through. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:58)</span><br />
